The Lives Improved model helps us to track our performance on a country-by-country basis in line \\nwith UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, allowing us to shape strategies to ensure healthy lives \\nand promote well-being for all at all. Management of key material people topics (Impacts, Risks and Opportunities)\\nWe depend on our people to deliver on our business strategy and our commitments to our \\ncustomers, patients and consumers and therefore place a lot of importance on managing the risks \\nand opportunities that pertain to our own workforce. We identify key impacts, risks, and opportunities around social topics, which inform our Business \\nand People strategy through the DMA process, tracking our performance in key material topics, as \\nwell as through our engagement with our people. In 2024, we identified (potential) negative \\nimpacts related to Health & Safety and Human Rights. For programs which Philips developed to \\nprevent and mitigate material negative impacts please refer to the polices and programs described \\nin this section. Philips did not identify any incidents of child labor and forced labor. The attraction \\nand retention of talented employees is critical to Philips’ success, and the loss of employees with \\nspecialized skills could result in business interruptions. Philips continuously assesses capability gaps \\nfor its key positions and has initiatives in place to close any employee capability gaps. For further \\ninformation, please refer to Double Materiality Assessment. Policies, metrics and targets\\nOur commitments to our people are observed in accordance with our General Business Principles, \\nSpeak Up, Human Rights, Health & Safety, Fair Employment and Diversity & Inclusion policies \\n(available on our ESG website (link) as well as on our intranet for employees). Our policies apply to \\nworkers employed by Philips (through a permanent or temporary contract, employed ‘at will’, or \\nthrough an employment scheme/WGP) and to ‘other workers’ (which includes contingent workers \\n(hired via an agency), interns, as well as contractors and their respective employees). The Philips Fair Employment Policy details the ethical and social principles that govern the \\ncompany’s relationship with its employees and other workers worldwide. The policy promotes \\ntransparency, accountability, and a positive work environment and is aimed at creating a fair and \\nequal workplace. In accordance with conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO), we \\nare committed to be free from forced, bonded and child labor, which extends to human trafficking \\nin line with our Human Rights commitments. The policy helps create an environment of inclusion \\nand belonging, where all employees and other workers are treated fairly, free from discrimination, \\nharassment, and other prohibited behaviors.'),\n",

Note IV Workforce of the future\\nAs reflected in our ESG commitments, we aim to be the best place to work for our employees, \\nproviding opportunities for learning and development, promoting an inclusive workplace, and \\nassuring a safe and healthy work environment. Our commitments to our people are observed in \\naccordance with our General Business Principles, Speak Up, Human Rights, Occupational Health & \\nSafety, Fair Employment, and Diversity & Inclusion policies. We continued our Total Workforce Strategy, which considers all sources of skills, capabilities, \\nlocations and changes in the labor market in order to deliver the Workforce of the Future. Globally, \\nwe work with different worker types: employees and contingent workers, as well external services. In 2024, we further focused on the implementation of our external workforce strategy. In addition, \\nwe have been looking at how we are attracting contingent workforce talent. Direct sourcing has \\nbeen expanded to 26% in the Netherlands and to 40% in the US, and has been rolled out to India \\n(11%). To strengthen the way we directly source contingent workforce talent, our own Philips \\nemployer value proposition is utilized for the different functions to attract these contingent \\nworkers. Total Workforce Strategy\\nWe use our Right Shoring & Sourcing methodology to implement the Total Workforce Strategy. This methodology steers improvements in workforce composition towards the ‘right \\nshore’ (onshore, nearshore and offshore) and the ‘right source’ (employees, contingent workers \\nand external services). The program delivered EUR 7 million in savings in 2024. To develop the workforce that can deliver our strategy we have a Strategic Priorities recruitment \\nteam who focus on the R&D, Patient Safety & Quality, Clinical and Informatics roles critical to our \\nsuccess. Together, in 2024, they delivered 1,555 roles. In all of our external recruitment we secured \\n38% candidates with Medical Technology expertise. Talent attraction\\nIn 2024, we continued to recruit the talent we need to deliver our strategy, filling 11,391 positions \\nacross the organization, of which 30% were internal hires. For external recruitment our strategic \\nhiring channels of Direct Sourcing (headhunting) and Referrals delivered 33% of our new joiners to \\nPhilips. Through collaboration with the Tent Partnership for Refugees, we continue to offer opportunities \\nto refugees across our operations. In 2024, we hired 120 refugees across the globe including the \\nfirst hires in the US, and we kicked off this refugee program roll-out in Mexico. We have been \\ncontinuing Tent’s Mentorship Program for Hispanic Refugees in the US and the Refugee Women in \\nthe US and EMEA. 2024 saw a further strengthening of our strategic Employer Branding efforts, alongside an \\nexpanded approach to Talent Marketing that now holistically addresses talent engagement. Externally, we advanced our talent attraction strategy through targeted media campaigns focused \\non critical talent segments and strategic capabilities such as Tech, Sales & Commercial, and Quality \\n& Regulatory professionals. These efforts resulted in a 62% increase in unique visitors to our \\nCareers website per job posting, and a 43% boost in applications per job requisition compared to \\n2023. Our ongoing employer branding content program continued across multiple channels, reinforcing \\nour position as a purpose-driven health technology company dedicated to patient safety, quality, \\nand sustainability. This helped us solidify our reputation as an equal-opportunity employer of \\nchoice. Notably, our marketing metrics showed double-digit growth in interest and favorability \\ntoward our employer brand compared to the previous year. On LinkedIn, our key media channel, by leveraging personal stories and emotionally resonant video \\ncontent, we established a distinctive, people-centric positioning that vividly showcases our culture \\nof impact with care for people, patients, and the planet. In recognition of our efforts, we were honored at the 2024 Employer Brand Management Awards \\nfor best aligning our Employer Value Proposition with our corporate brand values.

Philips diversity metrics methodology:\\nPhilips prepares diversity metrics (gender in senior management and age distribution) using the \\nPhilips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of employees, and Workday reports. Philips defines senior management as Corporate Grade 90 (senior director) and above, which does \\nnot differ from previous description. Philips defines management as Corporate Grade 80 (director) \\nand Corporate Grade 90 (senior director). The distribution of employees by age group is split into \\nthree categories: under 30 years old; 30-50 years old; over 50 years old. Persons with disability uses the Philips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of \\nemployees. Disability data is collected manually in countries where we operate with headcount. In \\nsome countries disability is registered through self-identification, while in others it is registered with \\nmedical documentation. Philips adheres to the local legislation and regulations when defining, \\nregistering and disclosing information on persons with disabilities among employees, as well as \\nwhen setting local strategies and targets. Due to the localized nature of the metric, there is no \\nconsistent global process in place to collect or validate the data, and official medical records are not \\na requirement across all countries. Work-life balance data is collected manually in countries where we operate with headcount and \\nuses Philips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of employees. Work-life balance \\ndata on entitled employees who took family-related leave is collected from our largest countries by \\nheadcount and further estimated. Note VI Employee engagement\\nOur People Engagement Survey (PES) saw increased participation, leading to a response rate of \\n84%, which means that almost 58,000 employees participated. The PES is a key component of our listening strategy, informing our Business and People strategy \\non employee sentiment and potential impacts, risks and opportunities.

On an annual basis, Philips experts organize quality trainings in the sustainability area for suppliers \\nin the scope of the SSP program. Responsible sourcing of minerals\\nThe supply chains for minerals are long and complex. Philips does not source minerals directly from \\nmines as there are typically 7+ tiers between end-user companies like Philips and the mines where \\nthe minerals are extracted. The extraction of minerals can take place in conflict-affected and high-\\nrisk regions, where mining is often informal and unregulated, and carried out at artisanal small-\\nscale mines (ASM).'),\n",

In the Netherlands, for example, we run a special employment \\nprogram, WGP (Werkgelegenheidsplan, or Philips Employment Scheme), to offer vulnerable groups \\nof external jobseekers a work experience placement, usually combined with training. Since the \\nscheme’s launch in 1983, 13,475 people have participated, and around 80% found a regular job \\nafter taking part. In 2024, we had an inflow of 60 candidates, bringing the total number of \\nparticipants in 2024 to 118. The WGP program is also accessible to refugees, and in 2024 we had 9 \\nrefugees participating. Note XI Health and Safety\\nOutlook 2025-2030\\nThe value of safety at work is changing, in light of the growing importance and corporate \\nrecognition of environment, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability; mental and physical \\nwell-being; psychological safety and human and organizational performance. The health and safety \\nof our people is core to Philips purpose. Our culture of “Impact with care for patients, people, and \\nthe planet” starts with taking care of ourselves and each other. Our purpose is to improve people’s \\nhealth and well-being, and therefore, we value a safe work environment and the health and well-\\nbeing of our employees. As we strive to look after the physical and mental health of our people, \\nthe H&S Leadership team embarked on a learning journey for further improvement in 2024. The \\nteam conducted a thorough review of internal and external H&S audit findings, conducted \\ninterviews with a wide range of stakeholders in the company, carried out SWOT analysis, and \\nreviewed and prioritized key focus areas. This information was used to develop a H&S strategic \\nroadmap 2025-2030. In 2024, the following key strategic programs were identified to drive further execution to our \\nvision:\\n• Leadership-led safety culture to further drive accountability and ownership for people safety. • Standardization and simplification of Philips’ Corporate Safety Standards (PCSS) to allow for \\nprioritized risk management and consistent implementation of H&S minimum requirements \\nworldwide. This includes providing guidance notes, templates, best practices, training \\ndocuments and work instructions.'),\n",

For five suppliers, a focused \\nassessment on human rights was conducted in 2024; this is distinct from the broader supplier \\nsustainability assessment approach, which covers sustainability more holistically as indicated in \\nSupplier sustainability & Workers in the value chain. Our Human Rights Report contains detailed information regarding our progress, targets, and plans \\nfor continuous improvement. 4.2.4 \\nSupplier sustainability\\nSustainability is a focus for the Integrated Supply Chain Function, which is actively collaborating \\nwith our partners, whether these be component suppliers or energy or logistics providers. Close \\ncooperation with our suppliers not only helps us deliver health technology innovations, but it also \\nsupports new approaches that help us minimize our environmental impact and maximize the social \\nand economic value we create. In 2024, our programs focused specifically on improving supplier sustainability performance, \\nadvancing human rights, responsibly sourcing minerals, and reducing the environmental footprint \\nof our supply base by driving the adoption of Science Based Targets. The sustainability performance of our suppliers is fully embedded in our procurement strategy and \\nways of working.\"),\n",

Philips SpeakUp program, and its underlying \\npolicies and procedures, aligns with relevant legislation on whistleblowing (including but not \\nlimited to Directive (EU) 2019/1937) to ensure reporters are protected from (attempted) retaliation. SpeakUp ensures standardized reporting and enables employees and third parties to escalate \\nconcerns 24/7. Concerns raised through this SpeakUp program are registered consistently in a \\nsingle database hosted outside of Philips servers to ensure confidentiality and security of identity \\nand information. Further details on how Philips ensures the protection of reporters of potential GBP \\nviolations, and ensures an independent and impartial review of concerns, can be found in the \\nPhilips SpeakUp Policy. Encouraging people to speak up through the available channels if they have \\na concern will continue to be a cornerstone of our GBP training, communications and awareness \\ncampaigns. GBP compliance officers and SpeakUp investigators receive training on following up on SpeakUp \\nconcerns in line with Philips SpeakUp Policy and investigation guidelines. Specifically in 2024, we \\nagain focused on increasing awareness about integrity and on emphasizing the importance of \\nspeaking up. This built on the deployment in 2023 of our biennial Business Integrity Survey, in \\nwhich more than 22,500 employees trusted us with their views and opinions on integrity within \\nPhilips. The results showed 79% of the respondents feel comfortable addressing concerns related \\nto the GBP. The next Business Integrity Survey will be deployed in 2025, along with an updated \\nGBP e-learning. In 2024, a total of 805 concerns were reported via Philips SpeakUp (Ethics Line) and through our \\nnetwork of GBP compliance officers. This represents an increase of 5% from the total of 764 \\nconcerns in the previous reporting period (2023). This is a continuation of a year-on-year upward \\ntrend.'),\n",

Continental’s 2024 IRO assessment has been conduc-\\nted simultaneously with both impact materiality (inside-out) and\\nfinancial materiality (outside-in) perspectives.\\nIdentification and creation of the longlist of IROs\\nThe list of sustainability matters of the ESRS 1.AR16 formed the\\nstarting point of the identification of impacts, risks and opportuni-\\nties. In addition for risks and opportunities, certain event types (e.g.\\nfines, loss of sales or growth of sales) were considered. These initial\\nscenarios and descriptions of IROs have been identified at topic,\\nsub-topic or sub-sub-topic level and have been aggregated when-\\never it was relevant and appropriate considering Continental’s busi-\\nness activities, value chain, geographical location, industries, and\\nbusiness models. Company-specific aspects were also considered,\\nall of which could be assigned to the predefined list of sustainability\\nmatters. These scenarios specify the matters further for Conti-\\nnental’s value chain and were partially split into individual scenarios\\nfor own operations, upstream and/or downstream value chain,\\nwhenever relevant.\\nInitial gross assessment\\nIn an initial step, the IRO scenarios were centrally assessed from a\\ngross perspective. The gross perspective assesses impacts, risks\\nand opportunities in a scenario that does not yet consider the exist-\\ning management approaches of Continental, as described in the re-\\nspective topic-related sections. This initial gross assessment com-\\nprised various assessments of the severity and magnitude of the\\neffect as well as the likelihood. This assessment was based on the\\njudgement and sustainability expertise of subject matter experts at\\nGroup level.\\nValidation and assessment\\nIn a second step, the longlist of IRO scenarios was assessed from\\nthe perspectives of relevant stakeholders. In multiple workshops,\\ndifferent functions of Continental acted as proxies of internal and\\nexternal affected stakeholders, subject matter experts and/or users\\nof sustainability information. The participants of the workshops re-\\nceived the longlist and further information on the methodology in\\nadvance of the workshops and were trained in the methodology\\nduring the workshops.\\nEach workshop included a validation, update and/or extension of\\nthe longlist. The IRO scenarios were then defined in greater detail,\\nthe gross assessment was validated or updated as appropriate, fur-\\nther information was collected and an initial net assessment was\\nmade. The net assessment considers the management approaches\\nof Continental, as described in the respective topic-related sections.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContinental’s due diligence processes play a key role in identifying,\\nassessing, and managing impacts, risks and opportunities. They are\\npart of the management processes described in this section under\\nGovernance as well as in the management approaches in the topic-\\nrelated sections. The assessment of impacts regarding human\\nrights is supported by the due diligence processes of Continental’s\\nResponsible Value Chain Due Diligence System (RVCDDS), e.g. re-\\ngarding actual impacts by incidents or the assessment of potential\\nnegative impacts (see especially the topic-related Own workforce\\n(ESRS S1) section and Workers in the value chain (ESRS S2) section).\\nWhere specific activities, business relationships, geographical loca-\\ntions or other factors lead to a higher assessment of the impacts,\\nthis was essentially taken into account in the description and as-\\nsessment of the IROs.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe assessments in the workshops also took the following into ac-\\ncount:\\n› Dependencies on the availability of natural, human, and social re-\\nsources at appropriate prices and in adequate quality, independ-\\nent of the potential impacts on those resources\\n› A primarily relevant time horizon for the definition of IRO scenar-\\nios and potential consequences\\n› Sectors and/or geographical locations where relevant\\n› External studies and other scientific evidence\\n› External data (e.g. country risk analyses and industry risk anal-\\nyses)\\n› Specific data for Continental or Continental’s value chain (e.g.\\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions)\\nConsolidation\\nIn an iterative approach based on the assessments during the\\nworkshops, an initial consolidation has been prepared by Group\\nSustainability in close coordination with Group Risk Management.\\nThe consolidation was completed especially based on the out-\\ncomes of all individual workshops as well as cross-checks with\\nContinental’s general risk assessment.\\nThe materiality threshold has been set after the consolidation of\\nIRO assessments. The materiality of negative impacts and risks was\\nassessed based on the gross perspective to consider where it is rel-\\nevant to have adequate management approaches and report on\\nthem. \\n\\n---\\n\\nDetails of the Material Impacts, Risks and Opportunities\\nThe actual and potential negative and positive impacts on people\\nand the environment are described in more detail within the re-\\nspective topic-related sections in the detailed descriptions of the\\nconcrete impacts.\\nMany of the impacts identified are inherent to the industry and are\\ndirectly related to specific types of business, products, value chains\\nor geographical regions. They can therefore be seen as impacts di-\\nrectly linked to Continental’s strategy and business models. Where\\napplicable, this is also addressed in the concrete descriptions of im-\\npacts within the topic-related section.\\nAs described in the methodology of the IRO assessment, Conti-\\nnental used a variety of input parameters to evaluate the IROs, in-\\ncluding both quantitative and qualitative data sources such as met-\\nrics, internal reports, and external market research.\\nContinental has defined the following time intervals for potential\\nimpacts, risks and opportunities following the ESRS requirements:\\n› “Short-term” is coherent with the reporting period in the consoli-\\ndated financial statements (up to one year).\\n› “Medium-term” corresponds to a period between the end of the\\nshort- period and up to five years.\\n› “Long-term” is defined by a period of more than five years.\\nContinental considers the primary time horizons to be those in\\nwhich the strongest impacts or effects are to be expected.\\nDepending on the topic, material impacts originate from own oper-\\nations or from business relationships. This information can be\\nfound in the respective topic-related sections in the subsections un-\\nder Material impacts, risks and opportunities and, in general, in this\\nsection under the Strategy, business model and value chain sub-\\nsection.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBased on the IRO assessment, taking into account the associated\\nlimitations and assumptions as set out in the subsection Process\\nfor identifying and assessing material IROs and taking into account\\nthe management approaches, targets and key actions for achieving\\nthe targets reported in the topic-related sections, Continental con-\\nsiders its business model and strategy to be resilient. The manage-\\nment approaches, targets and key actions for achieving the targets\\ndescribe Continental’s current ability to reduce its material negative\\nimpacts, increase positive impacts, manage risks, and seize oppor-\\ntunities. Continental also assumes that these skills will continue to\\ndevelop over time.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNegative impacts on adequate wages and fair payment Potential negative\\nimpact Short-term\\n40 Positive impacts on adequate wages Potential positive\\nimpact Short-term\\n41 Negative impacts on employees’ working time Potential negative\\nimpact Short-term\\n42 Positive impacts on employees’ working time Actual and potential\\npositive impact\\nPotential impact:\\nShort-term\\n43 Negative impacts on work-life balance Potential negative\\nimpact Short-term\\n44 Negative impacts on the health of own workforce Potential negative\\nimpact Short-term\\n45 Negative impacts on secure employment Actual and potential\\nnegative impact\\nPotential impact:\\nShort-term\\n46 Positive impacts on secure employment Actual and potential\\npositive impact\\nPotential impact:\\nShort-term\\n47 Positive impacts on social dialogue Actual and potential\\npositive impact\\nPotential impact:\\nShort-term\\n48 Positive impacts on training and skill development Actual and potential\\npositive impact\\nPotential impact:\\nShort-term\\n49 Incidents of discrimination in own operations Potential negative\\nimpact Short-term\\n50 Incidents of forced labor in own operations Potential negative\\nimpact Short-term\\n51 Incidents of child labor in own operations Potential negative\\nimpact Short-term\\n52 Infringement of employee's privacy rights Potential negative\\nimpact Short-term\\n53 Penalties due to incidents in connection with working conditions in own operations Risk Medium-term\\n54 Business interruptions in connection with training in own operations Risk Medium-term\\n55 Penalties in connection with discrimination in own operations Risk Medium-term\\n56 Penalties in connection with human rights in own operations Risk Medium-term\\n57 Loss in sales/boycott in connection with incidents of labor rights in own operations Risk Medium-term\\n\\n---\\n\\nc) Identifying and assessing adverse\\nimpacts\\nContinental has identified material actual and potential negative impacts.

These impacts are associ-\\nated with Continental’s strategy and business model and relate in\\nparticular to countries, certain markets, industries, and business ac-\\ntivities that are critically or significantly exposed to such impacts.\\nThe identified actual and potential impacts on own workforce are\\nimportant for adapting the strategy and business model. The devel-\\nopment of measures and strategic decisions based on the identi-\\nfied impacts are described as part of the management approaches.\\nAs indicated by the respective descriptions, all identified risks re-\\nsult directly from identified actual and potential impacts as well as\\nfrom the dependence on own workforce as an important intangi-\\nble resource. They are also based on the breadth and diversity of\\ncountries, markets, industries and business activities in which\\nContinental operates.\\nTherefore, the risks are inherently linked to Continental’s strategy\\nand business model.\\nThe consolidation at group level of the assessment of the impacts,\\nrisks and opportunities for own workforce includes Continental’s\\nentire workforce. Links to business activities, the product portfolio\\nand the value chain are taken into account where relevant.\\nIn general, our activities have an actual or potential positive or neg-\\native impact on the entire workforce of Continental – both own em-\\nployees and non-employees. The group of non-employees also in-\\ncludes temporary workers and subcontractors.\\nThe IRO assessment led to a deeper understanding of which parts\\nof the workforce are at greater risk of harm based on particular ac-\\ntivities, contexts or characteristics. This understanding results in\\nparticular from the consideration of industry specifics, regional\\ncharacteristics and potential discriminatory features as part of the\\nIRO assessment, as described in the respective IROs.\\nContinental operates in many industries, countries and markets\\nworldwide and is therefore also represented in regions where there\\nis considerable potential for negative impacts with regard to child\\nlabor, in particular India, Brazil and South Africa.\\nThe same also applies to forced labor (including so called debt\\nbondage), in particular in China, Mexico and India.\\nThe assessment of the material negative impacts regarding own\\nworkforce were integrated in the general impact, risk and oppor-\\ntunity assessment following the defined methodology (see the\\nOverview of material impacts, risks and opportunities subsection in\\nthe General disclosures (ESRS 2) section).\\nThe methodology takes into consideration two perspectives: All\\nnegative impacts are to be considered widespread or systemic as\\nthey relate to countries, certain markets, industries and business\\nactivities where Continental operates. In addition, the methodol-\\nogy takes into account event-based actual negative impacts\\nwherever the impact description contains a reference to concrete\\nactual incidents.\\nThe reported positive impacts on the workforce are related to the\\nactivities described under the management approach for the re-\\nspective IRO cluster.\\nThe material impacts on own workforce are not directly related to\\nchanges resulting from sustainability, e.g. the transition towards\\nzero-tailpipe-emission vehicles.\\nMaterial risks arising from the impacts and dependencies on own\\nworkforce relate to Continental’s entire workforce.\\n\\n---\\n\\nManagement Approaches to Own Workforce\\nThis section describes the management approaches that Continen-\\ntal pursues in order to address the material impacts on own work-\\nforce and the associated material risks. These are subdivided into\\nthe following areas: labor standards, adequate wages, work-life bal-\\nance, training and skill development, secure employment and social\\ndialogue, employee privacy, and occupational safety and health.\\nLabor standards\\nContinental has defined an approach for the management of labor\\nstandards for its own workforce that is intended to prevent and re-\\nduce actual and potential negative impacts and risks as well as\\nstrengthen positive impacts with regard to working time, discrimi-\\nnation, forced labor and child labor as well as other human rights\\nand working conditions. This is part of the “Responsible Value\\nChain Due Diligence System” (RVCDDS).\\nContinental is thus pursuing the ambition of creating good work-\\ning conditions and a 100 % responsible value chain by 2050 at\\nthe latest. As part of the RVCDDS, Continental has adopted so-\\ncalled Responsible Value Chain Commitments (RVC commit-\\nments), which include the following for the area of labor stand-\\nards: no child labor, fair payment, equal treatment, no forced la-\\nbor or modern slavery, freedom of association and working con-\\nditions, including working time.\\nWith the specific RVC commitment for equal treatment, Continental\\nstrives for a working environment that is free from discrimination,\\nincluding harassment, in any form. This is an integral part of the\\nmanagement system and is supported by dedicated diversity man-\\nagement aimed at promoting equal opportunities and advancing\\ndiversity and inclusion.\\nThe commitment explicitly addresses creating a working environ-\\nment free from any form of discrimination based on gender, age,\\nrace, skin color, health status, disability, social or ethnic origin, na-\\ntionality, sexual orientation, political opinion, religion or beliefs or any\\nother characteristics protected by applicable laws and regulations.\\nThe topic of inclusion and actions for people from vulnerable\\ngroups of employees are also covered by this commitment.\\nThe management approach also covers the prevention of potential\\ntrafficking in human beings, forced labor or compulsory labor and\\nchild labor. Continental firmly rejects any form of child labor and\\ndoes not employ people under the age of 15 or under the age at\\nwhich compulsory schooling ends or under the applicable coun-\\ntry’s minimum age for employment, whichever is greatest. Young\\nemployees under the age of 18 need to be treated with special dili-\\ngence. Any form of forced labor, modern slavery, debt bondage,\\ntrafficking, or any other form of labor not conducted voluntarily is\\nalso firmly rejected. Workers must be provided with documented\\nemployment terms or an offer of employment in a language they\\nare able to understand. Migrant workers need to be treated with\\nspecial diligence.\\nThe management approach directly covers Continental’s own em-\\nployees, while the RVC commitments also include non-employees.\\nOverall accountability for the RVCDDS, including the RVC commit-\\nments for labor standards, lies with the Executive Board. The latter\\nhas appointed a human rights officer who manages the system.\\nThe specific human relations (HR) frameworks for labor standards\\nare defined and implemented by the respective HR departments\\nalong the company structure. Responsibility for the implementation\\nof the labor standards lies with the management of the respective\\nlegal entities.\\nThe system is comprised of many processes that include strategy\\ndevelopment and implementation, the management of regulations,\\nimpact and risk management, incident management (including\\nwhistleblowing) and training. In order to monitor the effectiveness\\nof the system, a multi-stage process has been set up based on the\\n“three lines” model. The first line is formed by the local operational\\nHR departments. They implement the operational tasks at business\\nlevel and at the location in accordance with the RVCDDS and the\\nassociated HR rules. The second line, represented by non-opera-\\ntional HR departments and roles, oversees the system, roles and re-\\nsponsibilities as well as their effectiveness. The third line is Conti-\\nnental’s internal audit function, which performs an independent\\nevaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the RVCDDS.\\nSpecific preventive and remedial measures are defined for the re-\\nspective RVC commitments for the area of labor standards, which\\nare implemented by the legal entities, such as self-assessments, the\\nimplementation of appropriate rules and instructions, the careful\\nanalysis of the working environment with regard to aspects that\\ncould cause harm, the implementation of improvement measures\\nand control mechanisms, as well as raising awareness, especially\\namong managers.\\nWith regard to working time, Continental implemented further dedi-\\ncated processes with regard to flexible working models as stated in\\ndetail in the management approach to work-life balance.\\nAs part of an annual review process with the Executive Board, the\\nentire RVCDDS, including the specific processes for labor standards\\nin own operations, is evaluated in terms of effectiveness, adequacy\\nand potential for improvement. The RVCDDS is additionally inte-\\ngrated into Continental’s overarching internal control system, the\\nrisk management system and compliance management system.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWith regard to secure employment, Continental has established a\\nset of processes, projects and measures. They mitigate the nega-\\ntive impacts of the transformation on employees and simultane-\\nously create positive effects in terms of the creation of jobs and up-\\nskilling.\\n› In contract design, the focus is on providing employees with long-\\nterm offers. Flexible working time, mobile work options, and other\\nbenefits regarding employee working conditions, as described in\\nthe management approaches to work-life balance and adequate\\nwages, are intended to proactively reduce employee turnover.\\n› With regard to the impacts of the transformation, Continental has\\ncreated a range of opportunities to prepare employees for the job\\nmarket of the future. These are set out in the management ap-\\nproach to training and skill development.\\n› Job changes are also supported through a global internal job\\nmarket.\\n› Especially in Germany, which is significantly affected by transfor-\\nmation processes - for example, due to increasing digitalization\\nand technological change – Continental has established pro-\\ncesses to support employees in external job transitions to other\\nemployers that offer better employment opportunities at the re-\\nspective location (“von Arbeit in Arbeit”). These processes also in-\\nclude discussions with potential external employers.\\nThe effectiveness of the management approach is monitored via\\ndedicated feedback channels, HR processes and the reported metrics\\n“Percentage of employees covered by employee representation”,\\n“Employee turnover” and the OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engage-\\nment index.\\nThe processes are regulated through Continental’s internal HR rules\\nand by-laws as well as agreements with works councils.\\nKey aspects regarding secure employment and social dialogue are\\nregulated in particular by local laws, regulations and regulatory pro-\\nvisions.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProcesses to remediate negative impacts and channels for own\\nworkforce to raise concerns\\nGrievance channels for own workforce\\nContinental has established dedicated mechanisms to enable its\\nown workforce to raise concerns.\\nThese are part of a comprehensive integrity system that comprises\\nthree channels: an integrity portal, an integrity hotline and an integ-\\nrity email, as described in more detail in the Business conduct and\\ncorporate governance (ESRS G1) section of this sustainability report.\\nEmployees as well as third parties outside the Continental Group\\ncan report violations of legal regulations, fundamental values and\\nethical standards via these channels. The platform and hotline are\\nmanaged by a third-party service provider. The integrity email is\\nmanaged directly by a Continental Case Management team.\\nThe channels are explicitly open for all employee matters.\\nThe integrity channels can be accessed via our website, internal\\ncommunication channels or an international phone hotline. They\\nare available worldwide in many different languages and accessible\\n24/7, creating broad availability by overcoming barriers such as\\ntime zones or languages.\\nTo raise awareness of the integrity system, Continental has imple-\\nmented various channels and formats, including intranet articles\\nand formats, compliance newsletters and podcasts, mandatory\\ntraining and local on-site communication. Continental does not ex-\\nplicitly assess the awareness and trust of the own workforce in\\nthese channels.\\nIn order to protect users of the integrity system, information on all\\nkinds of potential violation can be reported anonymously. Report-\\ning and investigation information is treated confidentially in accord-\\nance with applicable laws throughout the entire case management.\\nThe whistleblowing process is in line with the German Whistle-\\nblower Protection Act and relevant international legislation.\\nThe integrity system is governed by a dedicated rule that defines\\nroles and responsibilities along the process steps of reporting, re-\\nport administration and substantiation, investigation, and sanction-\\ning – in an end-to-end process. The case management is also sub-\\nject to internal audits. In addition, Continental’s publicly available\\nrules of procedure provide transparency on the handling of cases.\\nFurthermore, Continental’s employees take part in mandatory train-\\nings on the topic of whistleblowing.\\nRemediation processes\\nWhen complaints are received via the whistleblowing channels or\\nthrough audit findings, Continental follows a structured process to\\ninvestigate and address the respective cases. Remedial actions\\nmust be implemented in due time and must be aligned with Conti-\\nnental’s frameworks. Based on these frameworks, the respective le-\\ngal entities must implement measures to resolve the violation effec-\\ntively and prevent similar incidents in the future. The remediation\\nmeasures related to submitted cases are tracked via a compliance\\ncase management software. Further information, including the\\ntracking of effectiveness, can be found in Business conduct and\\ncorporate governance (ESRS G1) section, the management ap-\\nproach Business conduct, corporate governance and corporate cul-\\nture, and in the subsection on Prevention and detection of corrup-\\ntion and bribery which describes the integrity system in detail.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThese measures are not only aimed at the achievement of the tar-\\nget but are also support the prevention of discrimination and\\nachieving equal treatment of employees in general.\\nBy mitigating the underlying negative impacts, it is assumed that\\nthe measures also mitigate to some extent potential risks to the\\ncompany arising from possible incidents of discrimination in the\\narea of gender diversity.\\nNo material positive impacts related to anti-discrimination and di-\\nversity were identified.\\nAlso, no material opportunities have been identified.\\nKey resources for the action plan include the expenditure for im-\\nproving the structural conditions and specific initiatives for women.\\nThe actions related to the target for gender diversity support the\\nmanagement approach to Labor standards by striving to reduce\\npotential negative impacts on the own workforce, also in the event\\nof conflicting economic and social interests.\\nThe specific initiatives for women focus on the entire female work-\\nforce, also beyond management positions. The actions relating to\\nthe structural conditions are much broader and ultimately address\\nthe entire workforce.\\nThe actions include short-, medium- and long-term measures.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWith regard to its own workforce, Continental has set itself a time-\\nbound target related to the matters diversity and gender equality.\\nContinental counts on the diversity of its employees. By this we\\nmean internationality, a balanced gender ratio, and a range of expe-\\nriences and age categories. Diversity is a key driver for different\\nperspectives within the organization and thereby promotes the re-\\nsilience in decision making. In addition, promoting diversity espe-\\ncially on leadership level is also considered to support the preven-\\ntion of discrimination and harassment in the organization. We have\\nset ourselves the public sustainability target of increasing the share\\nof female executives and senior executives to up to 30 % by 2030.\\nAn interim target on the trajectory for the target for 2030 is the\\nshare of 25 % female executives and senior executives by 2025.\\nThe scope of the target comprises all management positions (sen-\\nior executives and executives) worldwide.\\nThis target addresses the overall leadership culture of the company\\nand especially the impacts and risks related to equal treatment and\\ncombating discrimination, as described in the management ap-\\nproach Labor standards in this section. Indirectly it also addresses\\ntopics such as adequate wages and skill development.\\nThe progress of the target achievement is measured with the met-\\nric on gender diversity – share of female and male senior execu-\\ntives and executives.\\nThis metric is monitored continuously and reported at least once a\\nyear. The metric slightly increased in the reporting year to about\\n20.5 % compared to about 19.9 % in the previous year. It is thereby\\nstill within the expected range of the target achievement curve.\\nThe target was defined based on different internal calculations, tak-\\ning into account the related challenges as well as potential. The\\nmetric is calculated based on a defined methodology and has al-\\nready been reported for several years.\\nContinental has set up a dedicated HR community in where HR\\nmanagers can exchange best practices and insights between differ-\\nent teams across the organizational levels. It serves to tailor initia-\\ntives to specific needs and promote the continuous improvement\\nof Continental’s overall diversity and inclusion efforts.\\nEmployee representatives were actively involved in the target-set-\\nting process.\\nThe involvement of the affected interest groups, the identification\\nof lessons learned and potential for improvement, e.g. via networks,\\nis presented in the key actions for target achievement.\\nThe target has not been changed during the reporting period.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContinental assessed its potential and actual negative and positive\\nimpacts as well as risks and opportunities related to sustainability\\naccording to the regulatory requirements and as described in the\\nGeneral disclosures (ESRS 2) section. The general disclosures in-\\nclude an overview of the assessment of all identified impacts, risks\\nand opportunities (IROs), including the time horizons considered.\\n\\n---\\n\\nMaterial Impacts, Risks and Opportunities Related to Own Workforce\\nContinental assessed its potential and actual negative and positive\\nimpacts as well as risks and opportunities related to sustainability\\naccording to the regulatory requirements and as described in the\\nGeneral disclosures (ESRS 2) section. The general disclosures in-\\nclude an overview of the assessment of all identified impacts, risks\\nand opportunities (IROs), including the time horizons considered.\\nIn this IRO assessment, the following material potential and actual\\nnegative and positive impacts, risks and opportunities have been\\nidentified in relation to own workforce. They have been grouped\\ninto IRO clusters for easier understanding and reading. The descrip-\\ntions of the negative impacts and risks are presented from a gross\\nperspective which, on the basis of the applied methodology, does\\nnot take into account mitigation through the management ap-\\nproaches of Continental as described in the respective IRO cluster.\\nThis perspective is used to determine where appropriate manage-\\nment approaches are relevant and corresponding reporting is re-\\nquired. As positive impacts as well as opportunities are strength-\\nened by Continental’s management approaches, the descriptions\\nare presented taking a net perspective which, for methodical rea-\\nsons, considers the results of the management approaches.\\nThe descriptions of the IROs are to be regarded as self-contained,\\nwhich may result in repetitions.\\nLabor standards\\n› In 2024, Continental recorded individual incidents related to\\nworking time in its own workforce. Beyond the confirmed inci-\\ndents, Continental operates in countries, certain markets and\\nbusiness activities in which significant negative impacts related to\\nworking time can occur if they are not adequately prevented or\\nmitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 41)\\n› Continental operates in countries, certain markets and business\\nactivities in which Continental’s working time arrangements pre-\\nsumably have a significant positive impact on its own workforce.\\nAssuming that this can put pressure on other market participants\\nto also introduce higher standards, this could also have a positive\\nimpact on the market environment. (see ESRS 2, IRO table,\\nimpact 42)\\n› Continental has recorded individual incidents of discrimination\\nwithin own workforce for 2024. Beyond the confirmed incidents,\\nContinental operates in certain markets and business activities\\nwhere significant negative impacts related to discrimination\\nwithin own workforce due to gender, age, race, skin color, health\\nstatus, disability, social or ethnic origin, nationality, sexual orienta-\\ntion, political opinion, religion or beliefs, or any other characteris-\\ntics protected by applicable laws and regulations can occur if\\nthey are not adequately prevented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO\\ntable, impact 49)\\n› Continental operates in certain markets and business activities in\\nwhich significant negative impacts related to forced labor (includ-\\ning debt bondage) can occur if they are not adequately pre-\\nvented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 50)\\n› Continental operates in certain markets and business activities\\nwhere significant negative impacts related to child labor and\\nyoung workers can occur if they are not adequately prevented or\\nmitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 51)\\n› Continental operates in certain markets and industries where\\npotential incidents related to labor laws, other regulations or con-\\ntractual agreements with customers regarding working condi-\\ntions and labor standards could occur within the own operations.\\nIf, in the worst-case scenario, due diligence processes were to fail\\nand serious violations were to occur, Continental can face sanc-\\ntions with substantial penalties and fines or even business on\\nhold for the respective business operation, especially in the\\nmedium term. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 53)\\n› Continental operates in certain markets and industries where\\npotential incidents can occur in relation to harassment or discrim-\\nination in the workplace in own operations. If, in the worst-case\\nscenario, due diligence processes were to fail and serious viola-\\ntions were to occur, Continental could face sanctions with sub-\\nstantial penalties and fines or even business on hold for the re-\\nspective business operation, especially in the medium term.

If, in the\\nworst-case scenario, due diligence processes were to fail and seri-\\nous violations were to occur, Continental could face potential boy-\\ncotts, which in turn, if managed reasonably, could lead to critical\\nsales losses in the respective business activities, especially in the\\nmedium term. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 57)\\nSustainability Report –\\nSocial Information\\nContinental AG 2024 Annual Report Management Report Sustainability Report – Social Information 171\\nAdequate wages\\n› Continental has recorded individual incidents within own work-\\nforce related to inadequate wages and unfair payment in 2024.\\nBeyond the confirmed incidents, Continental operates in coun-\\ntries, certain markets and business activities where significant\\nnegative impacts related to inadequate pay or unfair pay can oc-\\ncur if they are not adequately prevented or mitigated. (see\\nESRS 2, IRO table, impact 39)\\n› Continental operates in countries, certain markets and business\\nactivities in which it can be assumed that Continental has some\\npositive impact on the market environment by paying adequate\\nwages if it is assumed that this could put pressure on other mar-\\nket participants to also pay adequate wages. This positive impact\\nis seen as relevant to the information needs of users of sustaina-\\nbility reporting. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 40)\\nWork-life balance\\n› Continental operates in industries in which significant challenges\\nto the work-life balance of its own employees (e.g. in connection\\nwith shift models) can arise if they are not adequately prevented\\nor mitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 43)\\nTraining and skill development\\n› Continental provides training and measures for skill development\\nin countries, certain markets and business activities where it is as-\\nsumed that the implemented training and measures for skill de-\\nvelopment for Continental’s own workforce have a significant pos-\\nitive impact on its own workforce as well as on the market envi-\\nronment, as this could put pressure on other market participants\\nto also offer training and measures for skill development on this\\nscale. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 48)\\n› Continental operates in markets with strong competition, includ-\\ning for skilled workers. If the company does not succeed in recruit-\\ning, retaining and training qualified employees or managing em-\\nployee turnover appropriately, this can lead to significant interrup-\\ntions and productivity losses in the respective business activities,\\nespecially in the medium term. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 54)\\nSecure employment and social dialogue\\n› Continental operates in countries, certain markets, industries and\\nbusiness activities that are undergoing a considerable transition,\\nwhich is already having a moderate negative impact on job secu-\\nrity. The transition could also have substantial negative impacts\\non employees in connection with job security (e.g. due to transfor-\\nmation projects, site closures or restructuring), if they are not ade-\\nquately prevented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 45)\\n› Continental creates jobs and provides secure employment and\\nqualifications in countries, markets and certain business activities\\nwhere it is assumed that this has significant positive impacts for\\nthe employees and the local markets. (see ESRS 2, IRO table,\\nimpact 46)\\n› Continental maintains social dialogue through various channels\\nand takes into account in particular the representation of its own\\nworkforce as well as employee participation, e.g. in the form of\\nemployee surveys, which is expected to have a significant posi-\\ntive impact, particularly on its own employees and their repre-\\nsentatives. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 47)\\nEmployee privacy\\n› Continental processes vast amounts of employee data in own op-\\nerations. In particular, given the size of Continental’s workforce\\nand the company’s global presence, significant potential viola-\\ntions of employees’ data protection rights can occur if they are\\nnot adequately prevented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table,\\nimpact 52)\\nOccupational safety and health\\n› Continental operates in industries and types of operations in\\nwhich there are numerous potential sources of health hazards for\\nemployees, particularly with regard to the use of machinery, phys-\\nically demanding workplaces, accidents and the handling of haz-\\nardous substances, ergonomics and psychological risks. In 2024,\\nContinental recorded accidents and health-related incidents. Be-\\nyond the recorded accidents and confirmed incidents, significant\\nnegative impacts on the health of own workforce could occur if\\nthese are not adequately prevented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2,\\nIRO table, impact 44)\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn line with the RVC commitments, the RVCDDS also defines the\\nframework for taking remedial action in own operations. Any identi-\\nfied violations must be addressed promptly and remedial actions\\nmust be implemented without unnecessary delay. These actions\\nare designed not only to end the violation but also to ensure that\\nsimilar issues are prevented in the future.\\nSpecific processes to prevent discrimination and to act accord-\\ningly if incidents are identified are part of the RVCDDS and the\\ngeneral processes of the integrity system described in the Busi-\\nness conduct and corporate governance (ESRS G1) section. The\\nprevention of discrimination is implemented through general HR\\nprocesses in the areas of improving frame conditions and specific\\ninitiatives for women, which comprise dedicated awareness-raising\\nevents, education offers as well as transparent HR processes in re-\\nlation to recruitment and talent management. With regard to gen-\\nder diversity, Continental has defined a target and key actions to\\nachieve the target, as described in the subsections on Targets re-\\nlated to own workforce and Key actions for target achievement in\\nthis section.\\nThe management approach is regulated by a dedicated responsi-\\nble value chain rule. It serves as the basis for further rules defining\\nspecifics for labor standards. They are complemented by special\\nprocesses that are focused on diversity and belonging. Additionally,\\nthe respect for human rights and fair working conditions are em-\\nbedded in Continental's Code of Conduct, which forms the basis for\\ncollaboration among all our employees.\\nContinental’s management approach to respect for human rights\\nand labor standards is in line with both international frameworks as\\nwell as local regulations. These include the internationally recog-\\nnized conventions on human rights, such as the United Nations\\nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\\nContinental’s management approach to respect for human rights\\nand labor standards is also in line with the key points of the Interna-\\ntional Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization\\n(ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\\nand the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These com-\\nmitments serve as a global minimum standard for all Continental\\nlocations and form the basis for compliance with local laws and\\nregulations. Additionally, Continental is a signatory of initiatives like\\nthe German Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter). The company\\nalso endorses the Women’s Empowerment Principles established\\nby the UN Global Compact and UN Women, demonstrating its dedi-\\ncation to promoting diversity and inclusion across its operations.\\nMonitoring of the adherence to these standards is anchored in the\\nRVCDDS review process, including a revision of its rules and pro-\\ncesses, if required.\\nTo incorporate stakeholder interests into the management system,\\nContinental has established various formats. These include specific\\nworkshops and conferences, which are defined as measures by the\\nlabor standards rules. Another format is the regular Employee Sur-\\nvey OUR BASICS Live in which Continental’s employees are asked\\nabout different topics related to Continental’s values. The integra-\\ntion of these interests into the system is carried out as part of the\\nannual review process.\\nTo ensure a comprehensive understanding and engagement related\\nto labor standards within the organization, Continental communi-\\ncates the management approach through diverse channels. This in-\\ncludes our website and internal communication platforms which\\nhost trainings as well as the frameworks. In addition, posters and on-\\nsite training courses make relevant information available to employ-\\nees who do not have access to the IT infrastructure. Furthermore,\\nthrough integration into the onboarding process, new employees\\nare also familiarized with these standards right from the start.\\nFurthermore, stakeholders involved in implementing the manage-\\nment approach have clearly defined roles within the RVCDDS and\\nare trained on the associated responsibilities to enable effective col-\\nlaboration and execution of the management approach.\\nAdequate wages\\nWith its management approach to adequate wages, Continental\\naims to provide fair pay for all employees, as anchored in the RVC\\ncommitments. In those, Continental has formulated the commit-\\nment that compensation paid to employees shall comply with all\\napplicable wage laws and regulations, including those relating to\\nminimum wages, living wages, overtime hours, and legally man-\\ndated benefits. In compliance with local laws and regulations, em-\\nployees shall be compensated for overtime in a reasonable way.\\nDeductions from wages as a disciplinary measure shall not be per-\\nmitted. For each pay period, employees shall be provided with a\\ntimely and understandable wage statement that includes sufficient\\ninformation to verify accurate compensation for work performed.\\nThe management approach covers Continental’s own employees,\\nwhile the RVC commitment also includes non-employees.\\nOverall accountability for the management approach lies with the\\nExecutive Board. The specific rules are defined and implemented\\nby the respective HR departments along the company structure.\\nResponsibility for the implementation of adequate wages lies with\\nthe management of the respective legal entities.\\nThe processes of the RVCDDS, as described in the management\\napproach for labor standards, also apply explicitly to the topic of\\nadequate wages as one of our RVC commitments. The system is comprised of many processes that include strategy development\\nand implementation, the management of regulations, impact and\\nrisk management, incident management (including whistleblowing)\\nand training, as well as the “three lines” model for system control.\\nContinental’s general remuneration processes include the involve-\\nment of employee representatives and the consideration of bench-\\nmarks. These measures create a basis for preventing inadequate\\nwages. In addition, further specific preventive and remedial\\nmeasures for the legal entities are defined in respective rules. This\\nincludes, for example, regularly checking whether payments com-\\nply with national and local legislation, clearly communicating remu-\\nneration principles to employees, ensuring timely and regular pay-\\nments and reviewing and updating appropriate benchmarks.\\nMonitoring is carried out through the annual review process of the\\nRVCDDS, in which the Executive Board is informed of the current\\nstatus and decides on the effectiveness, adequacy and potential for\\nimprovement. The effectiveness of the management approach can\\nalso be measured by the metric for adequate wages.\\nThe RVCDDS is formalized by a dedicated rule. Other rules define\\nthe specific aspects for fair payment and adequate wages.\\nWith its management approach, Continental follows the internationally\\nrecognized standards and frameworks on human rights and labor\\nstandards, as described in more detail in the management approach\\nto labor standards, as well as the applicable local laws on wages.\\nThe most important stakeholder perspective to be considered in\\nthe management approach to adequate wages is the perspective\\nof employees. To obtain this, the regular Employee Survey OUR BA-\\nSICS Live includes dedicated questions on the topic of remunera-\\ntion and recognition, with a special focus on fair payment. Remu-\\nneration models are discussed with the involvement of the respec-\\ntive works councils or employee representatives to ensure the con-\\nsideration of employees’ interests. Specific cases of inadequate\\nwages can also be reported through the integrity system.\\nThe consideration of this information is integrated into the over-\\narching annual RVCDDS review process.\\nTo inform all stakeholders affected and those involved in the imple-\\nmentation about the management approach, rules, trainings and\\nfurther communication material are communicated via Conti-\\nnental’s internal communication channels.\\nWork-life balance\\nContinental strives to create good working conditions to support\\nthe work-life balance and to promote the flexibility and well-being\\nof all employees, regardless of their working time model. In this\\ncontext, the specific requirements of the various markets in which\\nContinental operates and the different types of activities, are taken\\ninto account. One focus is on the challenges of work-life balance,\\nparticularly for employees working in shift models.\\nThe management approach covers Continental’s own employees,\\nwhereby the focuses vary depending on the respective work models.\\nGovernance of the respective measures and frameworks lies with\\nthe non-operational HR functions, while the implementation is del-\\negated to the operational local HR departments and managers.\\nOverall accountability for the framework lies with the Executive\\nBoard.\\nKey processes within the management approach cover the areas\\nof flexibility and further employee benefits. With regard to flexible\\nworking conditions, Continental has implemented a wide range of\\nmeasures to enable its employees to achieve a healthy work-life\\nbalance. These include, e. g. hybrid work, flexible arrangements and\\nworking time models, sabbaticals, family-related leave including pa-\\nrental leave, and partial retirement. Beyond this, Continental offers\\nits employees further benefits, such as childcare opportunities and\\nsport offers. Continental is actively expanding the opportunities of\\nflexible work and is also involving its shopfloor employees in the\\nprocess. For shift working models, Continental has implemented\\ndedicated processes in accordance with local laws, to enable\\ngreater flexibility. The implementation of these measures varies by\\nlocation and is tailored to local needs and regulations.\\nThe effectiveness of the management approach is monitored\\nthrough the results of the OUR BASICS Live employee survey\\nwhich is conducted on a regular basis. In the survey, employees\\nprovide feedback on how flexible working models at Continental\\nsupport them in balancing work and private life. They also give\\ntheir assessment of how they are able to cope with the stress level\\nin their workplace. This feedback helps to assess and improve\\nContinental’s approaches.\\nThe processes for improving the work-life balance of Continental’s\\nemployees are defined by dedicated internal frameworks and sub-\\nsequent country-specific rules in adherence with local laws. Addi-\\ntionally, a comprehensive set of guidelines, tools, methods, and up-\\nskilling initiatives has been created to promote flexible work models\\nacross the organization. The management approach is not based on specific external stand-\\nards, but on research findings and best practices with regard to a\\nhealthy work-life balance.\\nTo consider employees’ interests, Continental is pursuing a collabo-\\nrative approach by working closely with works councils and ac-\\ntively involving managers, employees and relevant functions such\\nas the law department. The OUR BASICS Live survey offers an addi-\\ntional channel for gaining insights into satisfaction with the work-\\nlife balance.\\nContinental communicates its management approach and flexibil-\\nity measures via the internal communication channels, making\\nthem accessible to employees at any time. This also includes local\\ncommunication channels to reach employees at production sites.\\nBeyond this, Continental actively uses its communication channels\\nto share information and guidance with its employees on how to\\nimprove their work-life balance.\\n\\n---\\n\\nTraining and skill development\\nContinental promotes continuous learning for employees to sup-\\nport them in meeting evolving skills requirements and thereby miti-\\ngate risks associated with skill gaps and business interruptions.\\nThe management approach covers all of Continental’s own em-\\nployees.\\nAccountability for the governance of training and skill development\\nas well as the related tools and learning landscape lies with the dif-\\nferent HR functions along Continental’s company structure. The\\nframework for specific trainings is defined by the respective func-\\ntions (e.g. safety and health or compliance). Responsibility for the\\nimplementation of the skill development measures lies with the\\nmanagement of the respective legal entities.\\nContinental’s learning landscape provides the frame for meeting\\nthe company’s training and skill development requirements. This\\nframe is filled with training content developed by the various func-\\ntions and entities to meet their specific needs and regulatory re-\\nquirements for employee training. Besides these function- or busi-\\nness-specific trainings, there are overarching training programs that\\nare managed by the HR departments and implemented locally, e.g.\\noffers for leadership development. To host these offers Continental\\nhas set up a dedicated learning platform. The platform categorizes\\nthe available trainings and programs by topic and makes them ac-\\ncessible to employees. It also manages the allocation of training\\nmeasures to employees. Monitoring of individual training programs\\ncan also be set up through this platform. In addition, the alignment\\non adequate training and development measures is an integral part\\nof the employee dialogue between supervisors and employees in\\norder to support individual skill development through a standard-\\nized process.\\nIn Germany, the Continental Institute for Technology and Transfor-\\nmation (CITT) is an additional important pillar that proactively of-\\nfers employees the opportunity to upskill themselves in future-ori-\\nented fields in order to prepare them for the evolving job market\\nand new requirements. The CITT offers programs and qualification\\nopportunities in the fields of robotics, virtual and augmented reality,\\n3D printing, agile methods and digital skills, and includes offers for\\nsemi-skilled workers, skilled workers and academics. In addition to\\nGerman locations, the offers are also available at some other Euro-\\npean locations.\\nThe management approach regarding training and skill develop-\\nment is defined in several specific HR rules.\\nFor the training architecture for leaders, the ISO Norm 29993\\nserved as a reference.\\nThe most important stakeholders with regard to training and skill\\ndevelopment are Continental’s own employees who benefit from\\nthe training and skill development offers. Their interests are taken\\ninto account in the management approach through feedback op-\\ntions on existing training materials. In addition, there are topic-spe-\\ncific learning communities that are established via Continental’s in-\\nternal communication channels. Individual interests and needs are\\ntaken into account through regular employee dialogue between\\nemployees and supervisors.\\nEmployees are informed about this management approach via\\ndedicated platforms within the internal communication channels.\\nThis includes the comprehensive learning platform as well as spe-\\ncific topic-related learning communities, which are aimed at em-\\nployees in specific areas and inform them about existing training\\nopportunities.\\nSecure employment and social dialogue\\nSecure employment and social dialogue are of the utmost interest\\nfor the company and for the employees. Therefore, with its corre-\\nsponding management approach, Continental strives to shape the\\ntransition of our industries in close dialogue with our employees,\\nwhile balancing economic and social needs.\\nThe management approach covers all of Continental’s own em-\\nployees.\\nIn principle, employment matters and social dialogue are regulated\\nby labor law. Therefore, the formal accountability for the manage-\\nment approach is partially determined by local legislation. This in-\\ncludes the responsibilities of the Supervisory Board, the Executive\\nBoard, the management of Continental’s legal entities as well as the\\nco-determination bodies, e.g. works councils. Operational imple-\\nmentation is primarily managed by Continental’s HR departments\\nalong the company structure.\\nSocial dialogue and employee engagement are managed through\\nvarious processes. Formalized processes especially include the rep-\\nresentation of employees by works councils or similar structures as\\nwell as the regular employee survey OUR BASICS Live. In addition,\\nContinental has established a variety of formats for social dialogue\\nand employee engagement, including townhall meetings, networks,\\nopen calls and online platforms. This foundation for social dialogue\\nis also the basis for managing employment matters in the transition\\nof our industries.\\nWith regard to secure employment, Continental has established a\\nset of processes, projects and measures. They mitigate the nega-\\ntive impacts of the transformation on employees and simultane-\\nously create positive effects in terms of the creation of jobs and up-\\nskilling.\\n› In contract design, the focus is on providing employees with long-\\nterm offers. Flexible working time, mobile work options, and other\\nbenefits regarding employee working conditions, as described in\\nthe management approaches to work-life balance and adequate\\nwages, are intended to proactively reduce employee turnover.\\n› With regard to the impacts of the transformation, Continental has\\ncreated a range of opportunities to prepare employees for the job\\nmarket of the future. These are set out in the management ap-\\nproach to training and skill development.\\n› Job changes are also supported through a global internal job\\nmarket.\\n› Especially in Germany, which is significantly affected by transfor-\\nmation processes - for example, due to increasing digitalization\\nand technological change – Continental has established pro-\\ncesses to support employees in external job transitions to other\\nemployers that offer better employment opportunities at the re-\\nspective location (“von Arbeit in Arbeit”). These processes also in-\\nclude discussions with potential external employers.\\nThe effectiveness of the management approach is monitored via\\ndedicated feedback channels, HR processes and the reported metrics\\n“Percentage of employees covered by employee representation”,\\n“Employee turnover” and the OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engage-\\nment index.\\nThe processes are regulated through Continental’s internal HR rules\\nand by-laws as well as agreements with works councils.\\nKey aspects regarding secure employment and social dialogue are\\nregulated in particular by local laws, regulations and regulatory pro-\\nvisions.\\nBy definition, social dialogue is an interest-based exchange with\\nemployees and their representatives. In order to gain further in-\\nsights and consider the interests of its own workforce in the man-\\nagement approach, Continental uses its internal communication\\nchannels and has integrated feedback processes into various en-\\ngagement formats and training courses. An additional formalized\\nprocess is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey, which gathers\\nthe employee’s opinions and views on various topics related to\\nContinental’s values. These are recorded, consolidated and ana-\\nlyzed in an established process. Furthermore, co-determination\\npractices such as employee representation on the Supervisory\\nBoard and the involvement of the Group Works Council in relevant\\ndecision-making processes directly incorporate the interests of em-\\nployees and enable the alignment of management strategies with\\ntheir needs.\\nMany communication and dialogue formats (e.g. townhall meet-\\nings) already inherently constitute social dialogue. In addition,\\nContinental’s management approach to secure employment and\\nsocial dialogue is also communicated to employees via established\\ninternal communication channels, usually in the broader context of\\nthe associated transformations. This includes newsletters and dedi-\\ncated channels managed by local works councils to inform the\\nworkforce. For information on training offers, a dedicated platform\\nis available, as described in detail in the management approach to\\ntraining and skill development. This is complemented by local com-\\nmunication on site to reach employees who do not have access to\\nthe IT infrastructure.\\n\\n---\\n\\nEmployee privacy\\nTo protect employee data, Continental has established a group-\\nwide management approach that addresses compliance with data\\nprotection regulations, minimizing the risk of data breaches, pro-\\ntecting personal data and promoting awareness of data protection\\nwithin the company. Continental thereby aims to ensure that per-\\nsonal data is processed worldwide in accordance with the following\\ngeneral data protection principles: lawfulness, fairness, transpar-\\nency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy and time-lim-\\nited storage.\\nThe management approach covers Continental’s own employees\\nas well as the personal data relating to potential or former employ-\\nees, customers, suppliers, other business partners, interested par-\\nties and other affected parties.\\nAccountability for the implementation of employee data protection\\nlies with the management of Continentals respective legal entities\\nas well as with functions at all levels that process personal data. The\\nappointed Chief Data Compliance Officer and team are responsible\\nfor defining and implementing the data protection management framework. The Chief Data Compliance Officer and regional data\\ncompliance coordinators also support the legal entities with the im-\\nplementation. Overarching oversight is exercised by the Executive\\nBoard.\\nThe processes for managing and monitoring the management ap-\\nproach include the following steps as part of a comprehensive data\\nprotection program: secure collection, processing, storage and dis-\\nposal of data. To ensure protection of the data across these steps,\\nContinental has implemented technical and organizational\\nmeasures such as encryption of sensitive data or access controls to\\nprotect data from unauthorized access. Further Continental ad-\\nheres to the principle of data minimization, meaning only collecting\\nand processing the data necessary for specific purposes. A regular\\n“Privacy Impact Assessment” is used to identify critical areas for ac-\\ntion and initiate appropriate measures based on the results. An-\\nother key process within the data protection program is the regular\\ntraining of employees on data protection.\\nThe management approach is based on the national data protec-\\ntion regulations in the countries Continental operates in as well as\\nthe Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) which are approved by the re-\\nsponsible data protection authority and ensure a level of data pro-\\ntection around the world which corresponds with the EU General\\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR).\\nTo monitor the effectiveness of the program, questions on data\\nprotection are part of both the regular audit questionnaire and the\\nrisk assessment questionnaire. The results of the evaluation are re-\\nported by the Chief Data Compliance Officer to the respective man-\\nagement as well as to the Executive Board.\\nData protection is an integral part of the Code of Conduct for em-\\nployees and is thus firmly anchored in the foundation of coopera-\\ntion at Continental. In addition, a dedicated rule formalizes the pro-\\ncesses in relation to employee privacy. This rule also includes\\nclearly defined BCRs.\\nWith this approach, Continental adheres to relevant data protection\\nregulations such as the EU GDPR.\\nBy definition, the most important stakeholders with regard to em-\\nployee privacy are Continental’s employees. Their interests are de-\\nfined in the relevant data protection laws. Concerns or complaints\\ncan be submitted via the channels provided for this purpose. The\\nChief Data Compliance Officer and regional data compliance coor-\\ndinators ensure that these concerns are addressed and integrated\\ninto the management approach.\\nContinental informs employees about data protection measures\\nand processes through internal communication channels. The com-\\npliance department manages dedicated formats, including topic-\\nspecific information pages, an internal newsletter and regular training\\nsessions to keep employees informed and engaged. Additionally,\\nstakeholders involved in the implementation of the management\\napproach receive specialized training and information through\\nstructured meeting formats and relevant rule documents.\\nOccupational safety and health\\nContinental has established a comprehensive management system\\nfor occupational safety and health in order to mitigate the impacts\\non employees in relation to health hazards such as the use of ma-\\nchinery, handling of substances of concern, ergonomics and men-\\ntal hazards. The system is aimed at implementing preventive\\nmeasures and eliminating hazards to ensure the well-being of all\\nemployees.\\nThe management approach covers Continental’s own employees\\ndirectly and non-employee indirectly.\\nAccountability for the safety and health management approach lies\\nwith the management of the respective legal entities, as legally re-\\nquired in most countries. Furthermore, individual accountability\\nplays a crucial role, as every supervisor and employee has a per-\\nsonal responsibility to uphold safety and health practices in their re-\\nspective function. The framework for safety and health is defined\\nby the safety and health organization, which also provides support\\nwith its implementation. Responsibility for the implementation of\\nthe safety and health matters is delegated to the location manag-\\ners who are supported by dedicated ESH managers. Responsibility\\nfor certain specific matters of occupational safety and health is reg-\\nulated individually. Oversight of the overall management approach\\nis exercised by the Executive Board.\\nOccupational safety and health matters are managed through\\nContinental’s ISO 45001-compliant occupational safety and health\\nmanagement system, which comprises processes and programs\\nfor complying with safety and health requirements for all locations.\\nKey elements of this system include specific processes that define\\nthe organization, implementation, reporting and training for rele-\\nvant safety and health topics such as occupational safety, health\\nmanagement, occupational medicine, ergonomics in the workplace\\nand handling of substances of concern (see also the management\\napproach Substances of concern and very high concern in the Pol-\\nlution (ESRS E2) section).\\nThe processes include establishing a clear structure for allocating\\nresources and defining roles and responsibilities within the organi-\\nzation, risk and impact management for the identification and miti-\\ngation of potential hazards, consistent and transparent communica-\\ntion as well as training and skill development for employees in the\\nindividual topics. Preventive measures are implemented on a site-\\nspecific basis in line with the overall processes.\\nReporting processes have been introduced to monitor the system\\nand internal audits are carried out on a regular basis. To support\\nthis monitoring, Continental has implemented targeted programs\\nsuch as the group sector internal safety & health audit program, to\\ncontrol the compliance with internal standards and identify oppor-\\ntunities for improvement. Furthermore, external ISO 45001 certifi-\\ncations validate the effectiveness of the management system at\\nmany locations. In addition, Continental monitors the effective of\\nthe management system with different metrics reported in the re-\\nspective subsection of this section.\\nThe safety and health management system also includes the dedi-\\ncated management of incidents in the workplace.\\nThe specific processes, responsibilities and monitoring measures\\nare defined in the rules governing occupational safety and health.\\nThe location-specific safety and health management systems fur-\\nther specify the requirements in relation to local needs.\\nIn the development and implementation of the management ap-\\nproach, Continental considers a variety of external standards and\\ncommitments to create alignment with international best practices\\nand legal requirements. Besides ISO 45001 as the international\\nstandard for occupational safety and health management systems,\\nthese include frameworks and standards such as the Luxembourg\\nDeclaration on Workplace Health Promotion in the European Union\\nas well as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration\\non Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and other relevant\\nhuman rights frameworks as outlined in the management ap-\\nproach to labor standards.\\nContinental considers its employees’ interests in alignment with\\nboth internal and external requirements. For this purpose, employ-\\nees and their representatives are involved in the relevant processes\\nto bring in their perspective, e.g. through ESH committees or con-\\nsultations with the works councils.\\nTo maintain transparency across all levels of the organization, the\\nmanagement approach is communicated via Continental’s internal\\ncommunication platforms. These channels are also actively used to\\nshare information with employees on topics such as ergonomics or\\nmental health and to provide them with personal tools. Another im-\\nportant pillar is training in occupational safety and health, which\\nalso includes mandatory training courses for employees and super-\\nvisors. These are either conducted on site or can be accessed via\\nContinental’s learning platform as presented in the management\\napproach to training and skill development. For additional local\\ncommunication, the EHS managers identify and assess the local re-\\nquirements and advise the location managers.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProcesses for engaging with own workers and workers’\\nrepresentatives about impacts\\nContinental uses various channels to engage with employees in its\\nown workforce. This engagement is part of the continuous devel-\\nopment of the described management approaches. The general\\nprocess for incorporating the perspectives of its own workforce\\ninto the strategy is described in the subsection on Consideration of\\nstakeholder interests and views in the General disclosures (ESRS 2)\\nsection of this sustainability report.\\nContinental implemented comprehensive internal communication\\nthat includes networks for exchange, as well as newsletters,\\nwebcasts and townhall formats to keep employees informed. An\\nimportant format for engaging with the workforce and gaining in-\\nsights into their interests is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey\\nwhere employees provide feedback on different topics related to\\nContinental’s values. These overarching channels are compli-\\nmented by local communication.\\nAdditionally, Continental is in constant dialogue with employee rep-\\nresentatives. In Germany, employee representatives are part of\\nContinental AG’s Supervisory Board. Employees are also repre-\\nsented by local works councils or similar bodies in order to take\\ntheir interests into account in strategic decisions and processes,\\nwherever possible.\\nEngagement with employees therefore takes place both directly\\nand indirectly via the employee representatives.\\nThe network channels described are continuously open for en-\\ngagement, while formats such as webcasts are held event-based.\\nThe OUR BASICS Live employee survey is conducted annually.\\nFor engaging with marginalized groups in its own workforce, Conti-\\nnental has established dedicated networks. These include for in-\\nstance specific networks for woman, as described in the key ac-\\ntions on the gender diversity target.\\nThe channels are managed by Continentals HR and communica-\\ntion departments across the organization. the Executive Board\\nmember for Group Human Relations (director of labor relations)\\nand Group Sustainability has overarching responsibility and is in-\\nformed by the departments on employees matters.\\nAn important tool for measuring the effectiveness of the engage-\\nment is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey. It records feedback\\non communication and employee involvement and forms the basis\\nfor the metric OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engagement index.\\nThe communication channels also include direct feedback options.\\nFurthermore, the metric on the percentage of employees covered\\nby employee representation serves as an indicator for social dia-\\nlogue coverage. \\nProcesses to remediate negative impacts and channels for own\\nworkforce to raise concerns\\nGrievance channels for own workforce\\nContinental has established dedicated mechanisms to enable its\\nown workforce to raise concerns.\\nThese are part of a comprehensive integrity system that comprises\\nthree channels: an integrity portal, an integrity hotline and an integ-\\nrity email, as described in more detail in the Business conduct and\\ncorporate governance (ESRS G1) section of this sustainability report.\\nEmployees as well as third parties outside the Continental Group\\ncan report violations of legal regulations, fundamental values and\\nethical standards via these channels. The platform and hotline are\\nmanaged by a third-party service provider. The integrity email is\\nmanaged directly by a Continental Case Management team.\\nThe channels are explicitly open for all employee matters.\\nThe integrity channels can be accessed via our website, internal\\ncommunication channels or an international phone hotline. They\\nare available worldwide in many different languages and accessible\\n24/7, creating broad availability by overcoming barriers such as\\ntime zones or languages.\\nTo raise awareness of the integrity system, Continental has imple-\\nmented various channels and formats, including intranet articles\\nand formats, compliance newsletters and podcasts, mandatory\\ntraining and local on-site communication. Continental does not ex-\\nplicitly assess the awareness and trust of the own workforce in\\nthese channels.\\nIn order to protect users of the integrity system, information on all\\nkinds of potential violation can be reported anonymously. Report-\\ning and investigation information is treated confidentially in accord-\\nance with applicable laws throughout the entire case management.\\nThe whistleblowing process is in line with the German Whistle-\\nblower Protection Act and relevant international legislation.\\nThe integrity system is governed by a dedicated rule that defines\\nroles and responsibilities along the process steps of reporting, re-\\nport administration and substantiation, investigation, and sanction-\\ning – in an end-to-end process. The case management is also sub-\\nject to internal audits. In addition, Continental’s publicly available\\nrules of procedure provide transparency on the handling of cases.\\nFurthermore, Continental’s employees take part in mandatory train-\\nings on the topic of whistleblowing.\\nRemediation processes\\nWhen complaints are received via the whistleblowing channels or\\nthrough audit findings, Continental follows a structured process to\\ninvestigate and address the respective cases. Remedial actions\\nmust be implemented in due time and must be aligned with Conti-\\nnental’s frameworks. Based on these frameworks, the respective le-\\ngal entities must implement measures to resolve the violation effec-\\ntively and prevent similar incidents in the future. The remediation\\nmeasures related to submitted cases are tracked via a compliance\\ncase management software. Further information, including the\\ntracking of effectiveness, can be found in Business conduct and\\ncorporate governance (ESRS G1) section, the management ap-\\nproach Business conduct, corporate governance and corporate cul-\\nture, and in the subsection on Prevention and detection of corrup-\\ntion and bribery which describes the integrity system in detail.\", 'S1_B': 'Material risks\\nFor a description of non-financial risks and how they are managed,\\nplease refer to the Risks and Opportunities report in this manage-\\nment report. Beyond this scope, no additional non-financial risks\\nwere identified in accordance with Section 289c (3) HGB.

Detailed information on the general forms of engagement\\nand communication with employees are included in the Own work-\\nforce (ESRS S1) section.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs the processes are implemented close to operational business,\\ncommunication with internal stakeholders takes place mainly\\nwithin the respective businesses. The primary form of external\\ncommunication is close dialogue with customers and suppliers.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContinental maintains social dialogue through various channels\\nand takes into account in particular the representation of its own\\nworkforce as well as employee participation, e.g. in the form of\\nemployee surveys, which is expected to have a significant posi-\\ntive impact, particularly on its own employees and their repre-\\nsentatives. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 47)\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn the IRO assessment, Continental identified both actual and po-\\ntential positive and negative impacts on its own workforce in the\\ntopic areas of labor standards, adequate wages, work-life balance,\\ntraining and skill development, secure employment and social dia-\\nlogue, employee privacy, and occupational safety and health as de-\\nscribed at the beginning of this section. These impacts are associ-\\nated with Continental’s strategy and business model and relate in\\nparticular to countries, certain markets, industries, and business ac-\\ntivities that are critically or significantly exposed to such impacts.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe effectiveness of the management approach is monitored\\nthrough the results of the OUR BASICS Live employee survey\\nwhich is conducted on a regular basis. In the survey, employees\\nprovide feedback on how flexible working models at Continental\\nsupport them in balancing work and private life. They also give\\ntheir assessment of how they are able to cope with the stress level\\nin their workplace. This feedback helps to assess and improve\\nContinental’s approaches.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContinental’s general remuneration processes include the involve-\\nment of employee representatives and the consideration of bench-\\nmarks. These measures create a basis for preventing inadequate\\nwages. In addition, further specific preventive and remedial\\nmeasures for the legal entities are defined in respective rules. This\\nincludes, for example, regularly checking whether payments com-\\nply with national and local legislation, clearly communicating remu-\\nneration principles to employees, ensuring timely and regular pay-\\nments and reviewing and updating appropriate benchmarks.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe most important stakeholder perspective to be considered in\\nthe management approach to adequate wages is the perspective\\nof employees. To obtain this, the regular Employee Survey OUR BA-\\nSICS Live includes dedicated questions on the topic of remunera-\\ntion and recognition, with a special focus on fair payment. Remu-\\nneration models are discussed with the involvement of the respec-\\ntive works councils or employee representatives to ensure the con-\\nsideration of employees’ interests. Specific cases of inadequate\\nwages can also be reported through the integrity system.\\n\\n---\\n\\nTo consider employees’ interests, Continental is pursuing a collabo-\\nrative approach by working closely with works councils and ac-\\ntively involving managers, employees and relevant functions such\\nas the law department. The OUR BASICS Live survey offers an addi-\\ntional channel for gaining insights into satisfaction with the work-\\nlife balance.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBy definition, social dialogue is an interest-based exchange with\\nemployees and their representatives. In order to gain further in-\\nsights and consider the interests of its own workforce in the man-\\nagement approach, Continental uses its internal communication\\nchannels and has integrated feedback processes into various en-\\ngagement formats and training courses. An additional formalized\\nprocess is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey, which gathers\\nthe employee’s opinions and views on various topics related to\\nContinental’s values. These are recorded, consolidated and ana-\\nlyzed in an established process. Furthermore, co-determination\\npractices such as employee representation on the Supervisory\\nBoard and the involvement of the Group Works Council in relevant\\ndecision-making processes directly incorporate the interests of em-\\nployees and enable the alignment of management strategies with\\ntheir needs.\\nMany communication and dialogue formats (e.g. townhall meet-\\nings) already inherently constitute social dialogue. In addition,\\nContinental’s management approach to secure employment and\\nsocial dialogue is also communicated to employees via established\\ninternal communication channels, usually in the broader context of\\nthe associated transformations. This includes newsletters and dedi-\\ncated channels managed by local works councils to inform the\\nworkforce. For information on training offers, a dedicated platform\\nis available, as described in detail in the management approach to\\ntraining and skill development. This is complemented by local com-\\nmunication on site to reach employees who do not have access to\\nthe IT infrastructure.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe effectiveness of the management approach is monitored via\\ndedicated feedback channels, HR processes and the reported metrics\\n“Percentage of employees covered by employee representation”,\\n“Employee turnover” and the OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engage-\\nment index.\\nThe processes are regulated through Continental’s internal HR rules\\nand by-laws as well as agreements with works councils.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContinental informs employees about data protection measures\\nand processes through internal communication channels. The com-\\npliance department manages dedicated formats, including topic-\\nspecific information pages, an internal newsletter and regular training\\nsessions to keep employees informed and engaged. Additionally,\\nstakeholders involved in the implementation of the management\\napproach receive specialized training and information through\\nstructured meeting formats and relevant rule documents.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProcesses for engaging with own workers and workers’\\nrepresentatives about impacts\\nContinental uses various channels to engage with employees in its\\nown workforce. This engagement is part of the continuous devel-\\nopment of the described management approaches. The general\\nprocess for incorporating the perspectives of its own workforce\\ninto the strategy is described in the subsection on Consideration of\\nstakeholder interests and views in the General disclosures (ESRS 2)\\nsection of this sustainability report.\\nContinental implemented comprehensive internal communication\\nthat includes networks for exchange, as well as newsletters,\\nwebcasts and townhall formats to keep employees informed. An\\nimportant format for engaging with the workforce and gaining in-\\nsights into their interests is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey\\nwhere employees provide feedback on different topics related to\\nContinental’s values. These overarching channels are compli-\\nmented by local communication.\\nAdditionally, Continental is in constant dialogue with employee rep-\\nresentatives. In Germany, employee representatives are part of\\nContinental AG’s Supervisory Board. Employees are also repre-\\nsented by local works councils or similar bodies in order to take\\ntheir interests into account in strategic decisions and processes,\\nwherever possible.\\nEngagement with employees therefore takes place both directly\\nand indirectly via the employee representatives.\\nThe network channels described are continuously open for en-\\ngagement, while formats such as webcasts are held event-based.\\nThe OUR BASICS Live employee survey is conducted annually.\\nFor engaging with marginalized groups in its own workforce, Conti-\\nnental has established dedicated networks. These include for in-\\nstance specific networks for woman, as described in the key ac-\\ntions on the gender diversity target.\\nThe channels are managed by Continentals HR and communica-\\ntion departments across the organization. the Executive Board\\nmember for Group Human Relations (director of labor relations)\\nand Group Sustainability has overarching responsibility and is in-\\nformed by the departments on employees matters.\\nAn important tool for measuring the effectiveness of the engage-\\nment is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey. It records feedback\\non communication and employee involvement and forms the basis\\nfor the metric OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engagement index.\\nThe communication channels also include direct feedback options.\\nFurthermore, the metric on the percentage of employees covered\\nby employee representation serves as an indicator for social dia-\\nlogue coverage.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContinental considers its employees’ interests in alignment with\\nboth internal and external requirements. For this purpose, employ-\\nees and their representatives are involved in the relevant processes\\nto bring in their perspective, e.g. through ESH committees or con-\\nsultations with the works councils.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProcesses to remediate negative impacts and channels for own\\nworkforce to raise concerns\\nGrievance channels for own workforce\\nContinental has established dedicated mechanisms to enable its\\nown workforce to raise concerns.\\nThese are part of a comprehensive integrity system that comprises\\nthree channels: an integrity portal, an integrity hotline and an integ-\\nrity email, as described in more detail in the Business conduct and\\ncorporate governance (ESRS G1) section of this sustainability report.\\nEmployees as well as third parties outside the Continental Group\\ncan report violations of legal regulations, fundamental values and\\nethical standards via these channels. The platform and hotline are\\nmanaged by a third-party service provider. The integrity email is\\nmanaged directly by a Continental Case Management team.\\nThe channels are explicitly open for all employee matters.\\nThe integrity channels can be accessed via our website, internal\\ncommunication channels or an international phone hotline. They\\nare available worldwide in many different languages and accessible\\n24/7, creating broad availability by overcoming barriers such as\\ntime zones or languages.\\nTo raise awareness of the integrity system, Continental has imple-\\nmented various channels and formats, including intranet articles\\nand formats, compliance newsletters and podcasts, mandatory\\ntraining and local on-site communication. Continental does not ex-\\nplicitly assess the awareness and trust of the own workforce in\\nthese channels.\\nIn order to protect users of the integrity system, information on all\\nkinds of potential violation can be reported anonymously. Report-\\ning and investigation information is treated confidentially in accord-\\nance with applicable laws throughout the entire case management.\\nThe whistleblowing process is in line with the German Whistle-\\nblower Protection Act and relevant international legislation.\\nThe integrity system is governed by a dedicated rule that defines\\nroles and responsibilities along the process steps of reporting, re-\\nport administration and substantiation, investigation, and sanction-\\ning – in an end-to-end process. The case management is also sub-\\nject to internal audits. In addition, Continental’s publicly available\\nrules of procedure provide transparency on the handling of cases.\\nFurthermore, Continental’s employees take part in mandatory train-\\nings on the topic of whistleblowing.\\nRemediation processes\\nWhen complaints are received via the whistleblowing channels or\\nthrough audit findings, Continental follows a structured process to\\ninvestigate and address the respective cases. Remedial actions\\nmust be implemented in due time and must be aligned with Conti-\\nnental’s frameworks. Based on these frameworks, the respective le-\\ngal entities must implement measures to resolve the violation effec-\\ntively and prevent similar incidents in the future. The remediation\\nmeasures related to submitted cases are tracked via a compliance\\ncase management software. Further information, including the\\ntracking of effectiveness, can be found in Business conduct and\\ncorporate governance (ESRS G1) section, the management ap-\\nproach Business conduct, corporate governance and corporate cul-\\nture, and in the subsection on Prevention and detection of corrup-\\ntion and bribery which describes the integrity system in detail.\\n\\n---\\n\\nEmployee representatives were actively involved in the target-set-\\nting process.\\nThe involvement of the affected interest groups, the identification\\nof lessons learned and potential for improvement, e.g. via networks,\\nis presented in the key actions for target achievement.\\n\\n---\\n\\nS1-2 – Processes for engaging with own workers and workers’ representatives about impacts Processes for engaging with own workers and workers’ representatives about impacts \\n\\n---\\n\\nStakeholders and Stakeholder Engagement\\nContinental maintains regular, ongoing dialogue with various stake-\\nholders via diverse channels.\\nFor Continental, the most important stakeholders with regard to\\nsustainability include in particular:\\n› Employees and their representatives,\\n› Customers, consumers, and end-users,\\n› Capital market participants,\\n› Policymakers,\\n› Affected communities and civil society,\\n› Actors within Continental’s supply chain, and\\n› Users of Continental’s sustainability reporting.\\nStakeholders are involved via the following channels:\\n› Employees and their representatives: e.g. via works meetings, em-\\nployee surveys, webcasts, meetings with employee representa-\\ntives and directly via the HR departments,\\n› Customers, consumers and end-users: e.g. via sales departments\\nor key account management, partnerships, trade fairs, surveys\\nand customer service centers,\\n› Capital market participants: e.g. via the Annual Shareholders’\\nMeeting, webcasts and roadshows,\\n› Public policymakers: e.g. via public affairs departments,\\n› Affected communities and civil society: e.g. via engagement pro-\\njects and open house events,\\n› Actors within Continental's supply chain: e.g. via the purchasing\\ndepartments and trade fairs, and\\n› Users of sustainability reporting: e.g. via published sustainability\\nreporting.\\nThe formats used to involve stakeholders differ depending on the\\nstakeholder group and are organized by the respective functions to\\nsuit the individual purpose. For example, employees are involved by\\nthe HR departments.\\nThe aim of involving the stakeholders is to bring together different\\nperspectives, discuss any discrepancies in views and learn from\\neach other.\\nThe results of stakeholder engagement in various formats, along\\nwith further analyses and new ideas, are continuously being incor-\\nporated into the process of further developing our sustainability\\nstrategy and reporting. In particular, the results of stakeholder en-\\ngagement are taken into account in the decision-making process\\nthrough the management approaches described in the topic-re-\\nlated sections.\\nIn the IRO assessment, an expanded understanding was created for\\nthe perspective (including interests and views) of the affected\\nstakeholders as described in the Consideration of stakeholder inter-\\nests and views subsection.\\nConsideration of stakeholder interests and views\\nIn general, the views of stakeholders serve as an information basis\\nfor the management approaches that are relevant to sustainability\\nand those that are described in the topic-related sections. At the\\nsame time, these management approaches in turn create an infor-\\nmation basis for the overarching strategy processes with regard to\\nstakeholder views. The described management approaches, market\\nrequirements, trends and other factors are taken into account as\\npart of the overarching strategy processes. When changing strat-\\negy, the interests and views of stakeholders are therefore mainly in-\\ncluded indirectly as one of many factors. Continental did not\\nchange its strategy or business models on the basis of the IRO\\nassessment.\\nContinental amends the strategy and the business models as part\\nof the annual strategy processes and the continuous strategic dia-\\nlogue in all group sectors as well as part of the topic-related man-\\nagement approaches.\\nContinental assumes that any changes to strategy or business\\nmodel has impacts on the relationship with stakeholders and the\\nstakeholders’ views – no matter whether they are based on sustain-\\nability-related decision-making or other reasoning. Continuous vali-\\ndation of the views of stakeholders is therefore relevant for the\\nevaluation of impacts, risks and opportunities as well as subse-\\nquent strategic decision-making. Further information on this strat-\\negy can be found in this management report in the Corporate pro-\\nfile section under the subsection Strategy of the Continental Group.\\nThe identification of opportunities and, in particular, the identifica-\\ntion of strategic opportunities as part of the IRO assessment was\\nalso linked to strategy processes.\\nThe views and interests of affected stakeholders with regard to the\\ncompany’s sustainability-related impacts have been considered in\\nthe IRO assessment.

As at De-\\ncember 31, 2024, the ratio of women was 30% in the first manage-\\nment level and 30% in the second management level.\\nAs a global company, Continental continues to attach high priority\\nto the goal of steadily increasing the proportion of women in man-\\nagement positions throughout the Continental Group, above and\\nbeyond the legal requirements in Germany.\\nDiversity concept\\nContinental counts on the diversity of its employees. The current\\nfocus of its commitment to promote diversity is on internationality\\nand a balanced gender ratio.\\nThe Supervisory Board also pays attention to the diversity of the\\ncomposition of the Executive Board. The Executive Board does the\\nsame when appointing people to management positions. As a basic\\nprinciple, the Executive Board aims to achieve a balanced ratio of\\ndomestic to international managers everywhere. The proportion\\nof local and international managers varies according to region. In\\n2024, a total of 46% of the Continental Group’s managers came\\nfrom countries other than Germany (PY: 49%). Continental is also\\nworking on increasing the proportion of women in management\\npositions. In 2024, we were able to increase this number to 21%\\nacross the Continental Group (PY: 20%). The proportion is to be\\nincreased to 25% by 2025.\\nIn drawing up the Executive Board’s succession plan, the Supervisory\\nBoard together with the Executive Board makes use of the measures\\nand programs to promote internationality and women in manage-\\nment positions, thus making it possible to identify and develop po-\\ntential international candidates and female managers for positions\\non the Executive Board.

The Supervisory Board is convinced that it will achieve di-\\nversity in its composition in particular by fulfilling the profile of skills\\nand expertise and meeting the targets for its composition.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContinental has recorded individual incidents of discrimination\\nwithin own workforce for 2024. Beyond the confirmed incidents,\\nContinental operates in certain markets and business activities\\nwhere significant negative impacts related to discrimination\\nwithin own workforce due to gender, age, race, skin color, health\\nstatus, disability, social or ethnic origin, nationality, sexual orienta-\\ntion, political opinion, religion or beliefs, or any other characteris-\\ntics protected by applicable laws and regulations can occur if\\nthey are not adequately prevented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO\\ntable, impact 49)\\n\\n---\\n\\nContinental operates in certain markets and industries where\\npotential incidents can occur in relation to harassment or discrim-\\nination in the workplace in own operations. If, in the worst-case\\nscenario, due diligence processes were to fail and serious viola-\\ntions were to occur, Continental could face sanctions with sub-\\nstantial penalties and fines or even business on hold for the re-\\nspective business operation, especially in the medium term. (see\\nESRS 2, IRO table, risk 55)\\n\\n---\\n\\nOverall accountability for the RVCDDS, including the RVC commit-\\nments for labor standards, lies with the Executive Board. The latter\\nhas appointed a human rights officer who manages the system.\\nThe specific human relations (HR) frameworks for labor standards\\nare defined and implemented by the respective HR departments\\nalong the company structure. Responsibility for the implementation\\nof the labor standards lies with the management of the respective\\nlegal entities.\\nThe system is comprised of many processes that include strategy\\ndevelopment and implementation, the management of regulations,\\nimpact and risk management, incident management (including\\nwhistleblowing) and training. In order to monitor the effectiveness\\nof the system, a multi-stage process has been set up based on the\\n“three lines” model. The first line is formed by the local operational\\nHR departments. They implement the operational tasks at business\\nlevel and at the location in accordance with the RVCDDS and the\\nassociated HR rules. The second line, represented by non-opera-\\ntional HR departments and roles, oversees the system, roles and re-\\nsponsibilities as well as their effectiveness. The third line is Conti-\\nnental’s internal audit function, which performs an independent\\nevaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the RVCDDS.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLabor standards\\nContinental has defined an approach for the management of labor\\nstandards for its own workforce that is intended to prevent and re-\\nduce actual and potential negative impacts and risks as well as\\nstrengthen positive impacts with regard to working time, discrimi-\\nnation, forced labor and child labor as well as other human rights\\nand working conditions. This is part of the “Responsible Value\\nChain Due Diligence System” (RVCDDS)\\n\\n---\\n\\nWith the specific RVC commitment for equal treatment, Continental\\nstrives for a working environment that is free from discrimination,\\nincluding harassment, in any form. This is an integral part of the\\nmanagement system and is supported by dedicated diversity man-\\nagement aimed at promoting equal opportunities and advancing\\ndiversity and inclusion.\\nThe commitment explicitly addresses creating a working environ-\\nment free from any form of discrimination based on gender, age,\\nrace, skin color, health status, disability, social or ethnic origin, na-\\ntionality, sexual orientation, political opinion, religion or beliefs or any\\nother characteristics protected by applicable laws and regulations.\\nThe topic of inclusion and actions for people from vulnerable\\ngroups of employees are also covered by this commitment.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSpecific processes to prevent discrimination and to act accord-\\ningly if incidents are identified are part of the RVCDDS and the\\ngeneral processes of the integrity system described in the Busi-\\nness conduct and corporate governance (ESRS G1) section. The\\nprevention of discrimination is implemented through general HR\\nprocesses in the areas of improving frame conditions and specific\\ninitiatives for women, which comprise dedicated awareness-raising\\nevents, education offers as well as transparent HR processes in re-\\nlation to recruitment and talent management. With regard to gen-\\nder diversity, Continental has defined a target and key actions to\\nachieve the target, as described in the subsections on Targets re-\\nlated to own workforce and Key actions for target achievement in\\nthis section.\\nThe management approach is regulated by a dedicated responsi-\\nble value chain rule. It serves as the basis for further rules defining\\nspecifics for labor standards. They are complemented by special\\nprocesses that are focused on diversity and belonging. Additionally,\\nthe respect for human rights and fair working conditions are em-\\nbedded in Continental's Code of Conduct, which forms the basis for\\ncollaboration among all our employees.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContinental’s management approach to respect for human rights\\nand labor standards is also in line with the key points of the Interna-\\ntional Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization\\n(ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\\nand the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These com-\\nmitments serve as a global minimum standard for all Continental\\nlocations and form the basis for compliance with local laws and\\nregulations. Additionally, Continental is a signatory of initiatives like\\nthe German Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter). The company\\nalso endorses the Women’s Empowerment Principles established\\nby the UN Global Compact and UN Women, demonstrating its dedi-\\ncation to promoting diversity and inclusion across its operations.\\nMonitoring of the adherence to these standards is anchored in the\\nRVCDDS review process, including a revision of its rules and pro-\\ncesses, if required.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor engaging with marginalized groups in its own workforce, Conti-\\nnental has established dedicated networks. These include for in-\\nstance specific networks for woman, as described in the key ac-\\ntions on the gender diversity target.\\nThe channels are managed by Continentals HR and communica-\\ntion departments across the organization. the Executive Board\\nmember for Group Human Relations (director of labor relations)\\nand Group Sustainability has overarching responsibility and is in-\\nformed by the departments on employees matters.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWith regard to its own workforce, Continental has set itself a time-\\nbound target related to the matters diversity and gender equality.\\nContinental counts on the diversity of its employees. By this we\\nmean internationality, a balanced gender ratio, and a range of expe-\\nriences and age categories. Diversity is a key driver for different\\nperspectives within the organization and thereby promotes the re-\\nsilience in decision making. In addition, promoting diversity espe-\\ncially on leadership level is also considered to support the preven-\\ntion of discrimination and harassment in the organization. We have\\nset ourselves the public sustainability target of increasing the share\\nof female executives and senior executives to up to 30 % by 2030.\\nAn interim target on the trajectory for the target for 2030 is the\\nshare of 25 % female executives and senior executives by 2025.\\nThe scope of the target comprises all management positions (sen-\\nior executives and executives) worldwide.\\nThis target addresses the overall leadership culture of the company\\nand especially the impacts and risks related to equal treatment and\\ncombating discrimination, as described in the management ap-\\nproach Labor standards in this section. Indirectly it also addresses\\ntopics such as adequate wages and skill development.\\nThe progress of the target achievement is measured with the met-\\nric on gender diversity – share of female and male senior execu-\\ntives and executives.\\nThis metric is monitored continuously and reported at least once a\\nyear. The metric slightly increased in the reporting year to about\\n20.5 % compared to about 19.9 % in the previous year. It is thereby\\nstill within the expected range of the target achievement curve.\\nThe target was defined based on different internal calculations, tak-\\ning into account the related challenges as well as potential. The\\nmetric is calculated based on a defined methodology and has al-\\nready been reported for several years.\\nContinental has set up a dedicated HR community in where HR\\nmanagers can exchange best practices and insights between differ-\\nent teams across the organizational levels.

A whistleblower can be any stakeholder of Continental, e.g.\\nan employee in Continental’s own workforce, a worker in the value\\nchain, a member of an affected community, a consumer or an end-\\nuser. The whistleblowing process is managed by means of a dedi-\\ncated internal rule that – in an end-to-end process – defines the\\nroles and responsibilities along the process steps of reporting, re-\\nport processing and substantiation, investigation and sanctioning,\\nall in line with the German Whistleblower Protection Act and perti-\\nnent international legislation.\\nThis rule on whistleblowing also defines a process for reception of\\n(potential) compliance cases, their prompt, independent and objec-\\ntive processing, review and investigation and introduction of\\nmeasures, especially regarding:\\n› Manipulation of (financial) accounting,\\n› Competition/antitrust law,\\n› Fair and ethical conduct, conflicts of interest,\\n› Corruption/bribery,\\n› Discrimination, harassment, psychological violence,\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe defined levers that have been implemented to achieve the tar-\\nget of women in management positions focus on improving the\\nstructural conditions to level the playing field for women. These in-\\nclude increasing flexibility through offers like childcare, mobile work\\nor part time options, as well as the use of objective and diagnostics-\\nassisted recruitment and training procedures. To create a culture of\\ninclusion and belonging, Continental promotes awareness and edu-\\ncation on these topics through leadership philosophy and develop-\\nment as well as guidelines on diversity and anti-discrimination.\\nContinental has also launched specific initiatives for women to pro-\\nmote their professional development. These include, e.g. events, of-\\nfers for talent management and development as well as networks.\\nThese measures are not only aimed at the achievement of the tar-\\nget but are also support the prevention of discrimination and\\nachieving equal treatment of employees in general.\\nBy mitigating the underlying negative impacts, it is assumed that\\nthe measures also mitigate to some extent potential risks to the\\ncompany arising from possible incidents of discrimination in the\\narea of gender diversity.\\nNo material positive impacts related to anti-discrimination and di-\\nversity were identified.\\nAlso, no material opportunities have been identified.\\nKey resources for the action plan include the expenditure for im-\\nproving the structural conditions and specific initiatives for women.\\nThe actions related to the target for gender diversity support the\\nmanagement approach to Labor standards by striving to reduce\\npotential negative impacts on the own workforce, also in the event\\nof conflicting economic and social interests.\\nThe specific initiatives for women focus on the entire female work-\\nforce, also beyond management positions. The actions relating to\\nthe structural conditions are much broader and ultimately address\\nthe entire workforce.\\nThe actions include short-, medium- and long-term measures.\\nThe key actions for target achievement are not directly related to a\\nspecific remedial process.

To ensure that their perspec-\\ntives are incorporated into strategic decisions, Continental is in reg-\\nular contact with employees and their representatives via various\\nchannels, such as works councils and co-determination in the Su-\\npervisory Board. Further information on the involvement of em-\\nployees and their perspectives in the overall business processes\\ncan be found in the Own workforce (ESRS S1) section. \\n\\n---\\n\\nThe system is comprised of many processes that include strategy\\ndevelopment and implementation, the management of regulations,\\nimpact and risk management, incident management (including\\nwhistleblowing) and training. In order to monitor the effectiveness\\nof the system, a multi-stage process has been set up based on the\\n“three lines” model. The first line is formed by the local operational\\nHR departments. They implement the operational tasks at business\\nlevel and at the location in accordance with the RVCDDS and the\\nassociated HR rules. The second line, represented by non-opera-\\ntional HR departments and roles, oversees the system, roles and re-\\nsponsibilities as well as their effectiveness. The third line is Conti-\\nnental’s internal audit function, which performs an independent\\nevaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the RVCDDS.\\nSpecific preventive and remedial measures are defined for the re-\\nspective RVC commitments for the area of labor standards, which\\nare implemented by the legal entities, such as self-assessments, the\\nimplementation of appropriate rules and instructions, the careful\\nanalysis of the working environment with regard to aspects that\\ncould cause harm, the implementation of improvement measures\\nand control mechanisms, as well as raising awareness, especially\\namong managers.\\n\\n---\\n\\nTo incorporate stakeholder interests into the management system,\\nContinental has established various formats. These include specific\\nworkshops and conferences, which are defined as measures by the\\nlabor standards rules. Another format is the regular Employee Sur-\\nvey OUR BASICS Live in which Continental’s employees are asked\\nabout different topics related to Continental’s values. The integra-\\ntion of these interests into the system is carried out as part of the\\nannual review process.\\nTo ensure a comprehensive understanding and engagement related\\nto labor standards within the organization, Continental communi-\\ncates the management approach through diverse channels. This in-\\ncludes our website and internal communication platforms which\\nhost trainings as well as the frameworks. In addition, posters and on-\\nsite training courses make relevant information available to employ-\\nees who do not have access to the IT infrastructure. Furthermore,\\nthrough integration into the onboarding process, new employees\\nare also familiarized with these standards right from the start.\\n\\n---\\n\\n In addition, further specific preventive and remedial\\nmeasures for the legal entities are defined in respective rules. This\\nincludes, for example, regularly checking whether payments com-\\nply with national and local legislation, clearly communicating remu-\\nneration principles to employees, ensuring timely and regular pay-\\nments and reviewing and updating appropriate benchmarks.\\nMonitoring is carried out through the annual review process of the\\nRVCDDS, in which the Executive Board is informed of the current\\nstatus and decides on the effectiveness, adequacy and potential for\\nimprovement. The effectiveness of the management approach can\\nalso be measured by the metric for adequate wages.\\n\\n---\\n\\nTo consider employees’ interests, Continental is pursuing a collabo-\\nrative approach by working closely with works councils and ac-\\ntively involving managers, employees and relevant functions such\\nas the law department. The OUR BASICS Live survey offers an addi-\\ntional channel for gaining insights into satisfaction with the work-\\nlife balance.\\nContinental communicates its management approach and flexibil-\\nity measures via the internal communication channels, making\\nthem accessible to employees at any time. This also includes local\\ncommunication channels to reach employees at production sites.\\nBeyond this, Continental actively uses its communication channels\\nto share information and guidance with its employees on how to\\nimprove their work-life balance.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBy definition, social dialogue is an interest-based exchange with\\nemployees and their representatives. In order to gain further in-\\nsights and consider the interests of its own workforce in the man-\\nagement approach, Continental uses its internal communication\\nchannels and has integrated feedback processes into various en-\\ngagement formats and training courses. An additional formalized\\nprocess is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey, which gathers\\nthe employee’s opinions and views on various topics related to\\nContinental’s values. These are recorded, consolidated and ana-\\nlyzed in an established process. Furthermore, co-determination\\npractices such as employee representation on the Supervisory\\nBoard and the involvement of the Group Works Council in relevant\\ndecision-making processes directly incorporate the interests of em-\\nployees and enable the alignment of management strategies with\\ntheir needs.\\nMany communication and dialogue formats (e.g. townhall meet-\\nings) already inherently constitute social dialogue. In addition,\\nContinental’s management approach to secure employment and\\nsocial dialogue is also communicated to employees via established\\ninternal communication channels, usually in the broader context of\\nthe associated transformations. This includes newsletters and dedi-\\ncated channels managed by local works councils to inform the\\nworkforce. For information on training offers, a dedicated platform\\nis available, as described in detail in the management approach to\\ntraining and skill development. This is complemented by local com-\\nmunication on site to reach employees who do not have access to\\nthe IT infrastructure.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe processes for managing and monitoring the management ap-\\nproach include the following steps as part of a comprehensive data\\nprotection program: secure collection, processing, storage and dis-\\nposal of data. To ensure protection of the data across these steps,\\nContinental has implemented technical and organizational\\nmeasures such as encryption of sensitive data or access controls to\\nprotect data from unauthorized access. Further Continental ad-\\nheres to the principle of data minimization, meaning only collecting\\nand processing the data necessary for specific purposes. A regular\\n“Privacy Impact Assessment” is used to identify critical areas for ac-\\ntion and initiate appropriate measures based on the results. An-\\nother key process within the data protection program is the regular\\ntraining of employees on data protection.\\nThe management approach is based on the national data protec-\\ntion regulations in the countries Continental operates in as well as\\nthe Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) which are approved by the re-\\nsponsible data protection authority and ensure a level of data pro-\\ntection around the world which corresponds with the EU General\\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR).\\nTo monitor the effectiveness of the program, questions on data\\nprotection are part of both the regular audit questionnaire and the\\nrisk assessment questionnaire. The results of the evaluation are re-\\nported by the Chief Data Compliance Officer to the respective man-\\nagement as well as to the Executive Board.\\nData protection is an integral part of the Code of Conduct for em-\\nployees and is thus firmly anchored in the foundation of coopera-\\ntion at Continental. In addition, a dedicated rule formalizes the pro-\\ncesses in relation to employee privacy. This rule also includes\\nclearly defined BCRs.\\nWith this approach, Continental adheres to relevant data protection\\nregulations such as the EU GDPR.\\nBy definition, the most important stakeholders with regard to em-\\nployee privacy are Continental’s employees. Their interests are de-\\nfined in the relevant data protection laws. Concerns or complaints\\ncan be submitted via the channels provided for this purpose. The\\nChief Data Compliance Officer and regional data compliance coor-\\ndinators ensure that these concerns are addressed and integrated\\ninto the management approach.\\nContinental informs employees about data protection measures\\nand processes through internal communication channels. The com-\\npliance department manages dedicated formats, including topic-\\nspecific information pages, an internal newsletter and regular training\\nsessions to keep employees informed and engaged. Additionally,\\nstakeholders involved in the implementation of the management\\napproach receive specialized training and information through\\nstructured meeting formats and relevant rule documents.\\n\\n---\\n\\nContinental implemented comprehensive internal communication\\nthat includes networks for exchange, as well as newsletters,\\nwebcasts and townhall formats to keep employees informed. An\\nimportant format for engaging with the workforce and gaining in-\\nsights into their interests is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey\\nwhere employees provide feedback on different topics related to\\nContinental’s values. These overarching channels are compli-\\nmented by local communication.\\nAdditionally, Continental is in constant dialogue with employee rep-\\nresentatives. In Germany, employee representatives are part of\\nContinental AG’s Supervisory Board. Employees are also repre-\\nsented by local works councils or similar bodies in order to take\\ntheir interests into account in strategic decisions and processes,\\nwherever possible.\\nEngagement with employees therefore takes place both directly\\nand indirectly via the employee representatives.\\nThe network channels described are continuously open for en-\\ngagement, while formats such as webcasts are held event-based.\\nThe OUR BASICS Live employee survey is conducted annually.\\nFor engaging with marginalized groups in its own workforce, Conti-\\nnental has established dedicated networks. These include for in-\\nstance specific networks for woman, as described in the key ac-\\ntions on the gender diversity target.\\nThe channels are managed by Continentals HR and communica-\\ntion departments across the organization. the Executive Board\\nmember for Group Human Relations (director of labor relations)\\nand Group Sustainability has overarching responsibility and is in-\\nformed by the departments on employees matters.\\nAn important tool for measuring the effectiveness of the engage-\\nment is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey. It records feedback\\non communication and employee involvement and forms the basis\\nfor the metric OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engagement index.\\nThe communication channels also include direct feedback options.\\nFurthermore, the metric on the percentage of employees covered\\nby employee representation serves as an indicator for social dia-\\nlogue coverage.\\n\\n---\\n\\nProcesses to remediate negative impacts and channels for own\\nworkforce to raise concerns\\nGrievance channels for own workforce\\nContinental has established dedicated mechanisms to enable its\\nown workforce to raise concerns.\\nThese are part of a comprehensive integrity system that comprises\\nthree channels: an integrity portal, an integrity hotline and an integ-\\nrity email, as described in more detail in the Business conduct and\\ncorporate governance (ESRS G1) section of this sustainability report.\\nEmployees as well as third parties outside the Continental Group\\ncan report violations of legal regulations, fundamental values and\\nethical standards via these channels.

A whistleblower can be any stakeholder of Continental, e.g.\\nan employee in Continental’s own workforce, a worker in the value\\nchain, a member of an affected community, a consumer or an end-\\nuser. The whistleblowing process is managed by means of a dedi-\\ncated internal rule that – in an end-to-end process – defines the\\nroles and responsibilities along the process steps of reporting, re-\\nport processing and substantiation, investigation and sanctioning,\\nall in line with the German Whistleblower Protection Act and perti-\\nnent international legislation.\\nThis rule on whistleblowing also defines a process for reception of\\n(potential) compliance cases, their prompt, independent and objec-\\ntive processing, review and investigation and introduction of\\nmeasures, especially regarding:\\n› Manipulation of (financial) accounting,\\n› Competition/antitrust law,\\n› Fair and ethical conduct, conflicts of interest,\\n› Corruption/bribery,\\n› Discrimination, harassment, psychological violence,\\n› Environmental rights,\\n› Export and import control, including sanctions,\\n› Human rights,\\n› Information and trade secret protection,\\n› Integrity of the whistleblower system, such as whistleblower\\nretaliation, or violation of confidentiality or the duty to report,\\n› Information technology (IT) security/cybercrime,\\n› Labor rights, including individual and collective rights,\\n› Market manipulation, including insider trading,\\n› Misuse of company property or services, and theft,\\n› Money laundering and financing of terrorism,\\n› Protection of personal data,\\n› Physical violence,\\n› Sabotage and vandalism,\\n› Terrorism, extremism and organized crime,\\n› Occupational safety and health,\\n› Sexual harassment,\\n› Tax evasion and tax fraud,\\n› Technical compliance (product compliance),\\n› (Digital) fraud, embezzlement and other forms of enrichment.\\nContinental provides whistleblowers with three whistleblowing\\nchannels: An integrity hotline with international and local phone\\nnumbers, an integrity platform (online form) as well as an integrity\\nemail address. These channels offer possibilities for confidential\\nand anonymous reporting of (potential) compliance cases.\\nThese cases are reviewed by a dedicated team of case managers\\nwithin the compliance organization who forward the cases to the\\ninternal audit departments for investigation if a report can be sub-\\nstantiated.

As part of Schneider Electric’s annual employee\\nengagement survey, 74% of employees feel that the organization\\nactively looks after the well-being of its employees and 81% of\\nemployees say that they have the flexibility to modify their work\\narrangements as needed. These numbers help the organization\\nunderstand the impact of its policies and actions as well as help\\ninform the future actions.\\n\\n---\\n\\nEmployee engagement process\\nEngaged employees are key to enable the Company to be at its\\nbest and support the achievement of the Group strategy.\\nEmployees are invited to share their honest feedback through an\\nannual engagement survey, which measures ten key drivers,\\nincluding well-being, inclusion, recognition, and empowerment.\\nThrough the information collected, the Company gains greater\\nunderstanding of the views of employees, including areas of\\nstrength and improvement. Insights are used to inform action plans\\nacross the organization. Leaders are guided to co-create the\\nactions with their teams, reinforcing the dialogue needed to shape\\nthe workplace of tomorrow.\\nThis process also contributes to the impacts, risks, and\\nopportunities mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.\\n\\n---\\n\\nTraining and skills\\ndevelopment\\nImpacts, risks and opportunities\\nTraining and skills development\\nPositive Impact Improve employability of\\nemployees\\nIn today’s landscape, the ability to attract, develop, and retain\\ntalent is paramount for ensuring the sustained success of\\ncompanies. Business growth in markets around the globe, in\\nconjunction with the rapidly evolving world, requires focused\\nacquisition and accelerated skill development, especially in\\ntechnical, digital, human, and commercial areas, of the workforce.\\nSchneider is committed to preparing and executing a robust\\nbuild, buy, borrow workforce and talent plan to optimize its its\\nfuture readiness and create a culture with shared values for\\nall employees.\\nDue to the current talent and skills scarcity in the market, the\\ncurrent VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) world and\\nthe unprecedented changes in the future of work, Schneider is not\\nimmune to talent and skills risks.\\nThe risk of not attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent\\nin the market, especially for critical skills, would have an impact\\nin terms of:\\n• Cost of recruiting and onboarding;\\n• Gaps in critical skills to drive growth and innovation and to\\nstay ahead of the competition;\\n• Succession pipeline for critical expert and leadership\\npositions; and\\n• Schneider ’s employer brand\\n\\n---\\n\\nAmplifying a culture of growth and impact\\nSchneider Electric’s approach to performance management is\\nanchored by the Group’s Employee Value Proposition “Impact\\nstarts with us” and it is a key enabler to its collective success and\\ndemonstration of its IMPACT values. At the heart of this culture is\\nthe belief that everyone is a talent and has the potential to be an\\nImpact Maker, translating their goals into real actions through\\nmeaningful discussions, feedback, coaching, and recognition.\\nThe Group’s robust process of setting individual performance\\nand development goals set clear expectations for individual and\\ncollective performance. The performance management framework\\n(1) This includes employees whose employment status is active (or suspended, which is country specific), who are on permanent/ fixed term contract type, who are\\ninformation workers and those who were hired on or before 30 Sept 2024, in addition to country or entity specific conditions.\\nassumes positive intent, meaning Schneider trusts that its\\nemployees aim to make an impact. Impact is not measured solely\\nby activity, but the outcomes which benefit customers, the business\\nor team.\\nEmployees’ overall impact is assessed considering the following\\nthree dimensions equally:\\n• Individual behaviors aligning with IMPACT Values\\n• Individual achievements\\n• Contributions to others’ success\\nSchneider Electric employees are encouraged to seek, give, and\\nreceive feedback, empowering them to take ownership for driving\\ntheir individual impact. Managers are encouraged to have regular,\\nagile and meaningful conversations throughout the year with\\ncoaching, feedback and recognition while re-visiting goals and\\npriorities. Managers set team goals aligning with the collective\\nteam priority to win as a team and achieve together. In 2024,\\n99.4% of eligible employees(1) completed a performance and\\ndevelopment review.\\n(*)This includes employees whose employment status is active (or\\nsuspended, which is country specific), who are on permanent/\\nfixed term contract type, who are information workers and those\\nwho were hired on or before 30 Sept 2024, in addition to country or\\nentity specific conditions.\\nEnabling sustainable careers\\nThe Group recognizes that its people are the driving force fueling\\nSchneider’s profitable growth and empowers them to grow to their\\nfullest potential by developing new skills and building careers for\\ntoday and tomorrow. In line with the conviction that all employees\\nare talent and the aim to provide equitable development\\nopportunities for all, Schneider Electric considers that all\\nemployees should take ownership of their own unique career\\ndevelopment, supported by their managers and enabled by digital\\ntools. The Group encourages employees to build a sustainable\\nT-shaped career by striking the balance between deepening their\\nexpertise in different domains and broadening their skillset through\\nexperiences in diverse contexts to increase their impact. This will\\nhelp them keep themselves relevant and marketable in a rapidly\\nchanging world.\\nTo empower and engage employees with this approach, Schneider\\nElectric held its fourth edition of “Career Days” for all employees in\\n2024. Under the theme “Unleash your skills for growth and impact”\\nmore than 100 events took place with employees participating from\\nover 100 countries; getting inspired by diverse career stories,\\nunleashing the power of networking and mentoring, having career\\nconversations, learning about different roles, skills, and industry\\ntrends, and being equipped with tools and resources to develop,\\ngrow, and shape their future. 94% of employees surveyed were\\npositive about the program, highlighting that it helped them to\\nreflect about their career aspirations, encouraged them to own their\\ncareer, and inspired them to build a more sustainable career. The\\nCareer Days theme, design, and activities are shaped every year\\nby considering both the strategic people priorities and the\\nfeedback from Schneider Electric employees provided in the\\nannual engagement survey and in the targeted Career\\nDevelopment survey.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn addition to career programs for early talent, in 2021 Schneider\\nlaunched its Senior Talent program with the firm belief that\\nemployees who are near or at the later stages of their professional\\ncareers (“senior talent”) bring unique expertise, experience, and\\nwisdom to the business. The Senior Talent program recognizes this\\ncontribution and empowers them to continue making an impact on\\nthe Company while taking ownership and designing the next stage\\nof their careers. The program is anchored in career conversations\\nresulting in a robust development plan linked to their unique career\\naspirations and supported by different offers including new\\ncontractual opportunities, upskilling, knowledge transfer, pivoting,\\nrecognition, care, and personal planning among others.\\nSince its launch, the Group has started to observe the positive\\nimpact of the program, which is being progressively deployed\\nand scaled globally in waves.\\nThe commitment and progress are measured through SSE #23\\nwhich aims at providing meaningful development programs for\\nat least 90% of employees in the later stages of their career\\nby 2025.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSince the program launch in 2017, 5,300+\\nleaders were trained. Perceived value/\\nsatisfaction was 4.4 - 4.9 across all program\\nlevels and cohorts.\\nThe feedback from the impact survey\\nconducted in 2024 on a sample of 1,000 TSL\\ngraduates confirmed positive impact:\\n• 87% agreed that TSL “changed my\\nleadership for the better at Schneider\\nElectric”\\n• 91.8% agreed they “benefited from the\\nprogram as a person”\\n• 80.2% agreed “their work during and after\\nthe program has made a difference at\\nSchneider Electric”. More specifically, they\\nagreed that the program helped them: lead\\nwith more courage (78%); lead with more\\ncare (81%); enhance their resilience (74%);\\nincrease their ability to influence (76%); build\\ncloser relationships (74%); manage, diverse\\ngroups (82%); and build a broader network\\n(79%).\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt also states Schneider Electric’s commitment to provide or support\\nremedy in case the Group has caused or contributed to a negative\\nimpact.

Risk health and safety impacts on\\npeople through industrial accidents\\n\\n---\\n\\nTo accompany employees in creating a future based on their\\nindividual aspirations, Schneider Electric Initiatives (which groups\\nCreation Pass, Solidarity Pass, Competencies Pass, Education\\nPass, and Reconversion Pass) offers five innovative pathways to\\nsupport employees in designing their professional future while\\nhaving a positive impact on the local community.\\n1. The Creation Pass: an internal support system to help\\nemployees start their own business. In the past 11 years, 795\\n(54 in 2024) projects have been supported and 417 (12 in 2024)\\nof them have resulted in the creation or takeover of a business.\\nThese businesses have created more than 520 (22 in 2024)\\njobs.\\n2. The Solidarity Pass: a skill sponsorship which allows employees\\nto offer their skills, energy, and dedication to an NGO. In the\\npast 11 years, 147 (33 in 2024) employees have benefited from\\na Solidarity Pass.\\n3. The Competencies Pass: a skill sponsorship where employees\\noffer start-ups/SMEs their knowledge and skills to enable local\\neconomic development. In the past 11 years, 12 employees\\nhave benefited from a Compentencies Pass.\\n4. The Education Pass: a skill sponsorship where employees can\\noffer their knowledge and skills to an educational body (e.g.,\\npartner universities and educational ministries). This Pass\\nenvelops the already known IPE (Ingenieurs pour l’école or\\nEngineers for Schools) with 20 employees participating in 2024\\nand a new option as a professor or training project leader in the\\nSchneider Electric School or with a partner of the Schneider\\nElectric School. In 2024, one employee benefited from this\\nnew format.\\n5. The Reconversion Pass: this new format was added in 2024 to\\nsupport an employee to be trained in a new profession and then\\ntransfer to a new job externally.\\nStarting this year, employees are given even more flexibility to\\ndesign their own career paths through offers with DuoPro, allowing\\nthem to continue working for Schneider Electric on a part time basis\\nand using that extra time to either (1) work for another non-\\ncompeting company, (2) freelance, or (3) create their own business.\\nIn France, these initiatives are connected to, represented in, and\\nsupport local business networks, local public stakeholders, and\\nlocal NGOs.\\n\\n---\\n\\nImpacts, risks and opportunities\\nHealth and safety\\nNegative Impact Damage the physical integrity\\nof employees\\nHealth and safety is one of the risk drivers of the ERM model, which\\nis part of a formal corporate risk assessment, identifying Key Risk\\nIndicators (KRIs) and implementing action plans to reduce risk. The\\nfocus of this model is to concentrate at global level, on risks that\\ncan result in serious or fatal accidents. This involves looking\\nbeyond the top 5 hazards and analyzing the controls preventing\\naccidents from occurring and connects to Schneider Electric’s\\nHigh Potential Severity (HiPoS) program. Those hazards that have\\nthe potential to result in serious accidents have a deeper analysis\\nby global experts, and the learnings are then shared with the full\\norganization.\\nAs well as driving specific actions, the ERM and HiPoS programs\\nalso contribute to the annual global Health and Safety Improvement\\nprogram.\\nRegarding legal compliance risk, all Schneider Electric sites\\nprepare a Health and Safety legal register, audit themselves\\nagainst the required regulations, and implement actions to close\\nthe gaps. The full process is audited as part of the ISO 45001\\nOccupational health and safety management systems external\\ncertification.\\nPolicy\\nSchneider Electric is committed to invest in its people and its\\nworkplace as stated in its Group Health and Safety Policy, which is\\nreviewed each year and is fully aligned with ISO 45001 standard\\nand is published externally. The implementation of the Health &\\nSafety Policy is monitored by the Chief Compliance Officer.\\nEach employee plays a key role in identifying and mitigating\\nhazards. This practice applies at Schneider Electric sites, at\\ncustomer sites and while driving or traveling.\\nThe Group values engagement at all levels and:\\n• Expects each manager to role model health and safety as\\ndefined in the Global Safety Strategy;\\n• Empowers employees to take ownership, for themselves and\\ntheir team, of health and safety;\\n• Gathers the views of all employees, their representatives, and\\nthose working on the Group’s behalf, through consultation,\\nincluding their participation in reporting and resolving safety\\nimprovement opportunities;\\n• Recognizes employees who propose health and safety\\ninnovations or implement solutions; and\\n• Sustains relationships with suppliers, contractors, and\\ncustomers under the condition that safety commitments are\\nagreed and met.\\nThe Group provides a safe work environment for all and:\\n• Invests in resources and training to support Schneider’s health\\nand safety vision and goals;\\n• Complies to external legal requirements and internal directives;\\n• Embeds health and safety into its business practices and is an\\nintegral part of all major decisions, from acquisition, product\\ndevelopment, the launch of a business and change\\nmanagement; and\\n• Is determined to eliminate hazards and reduce risks.\\nThe Group communicates in an open and transparent manner and:\\n• Continually improves its health and safety systems by\\nbenchmarking, adopting best available techniques, and through\\ncontinuous learning;\\n• Captures, analyzes, and communicates High Potential Severity\\n(HiPoS) events, safety improvement opportunities, near misses,\\nand incidents in a systematic manner;\\n• Creates global action plans and shares with all potentially\\nimpacted employees to prevent incident (re)occurrence; and\\n• Sets safety and occupational health goals and objectives,\\nmonitors performance, and reports progress internally and\\nexternally.\\nAction plan\\nThe fundamentals of the Health and Safety action plan are based\\non the Health & Safety Policy, supported by the ERM program and\\nis the framework for deploying the 2025 Health and Safety strategy\\n“S.A.F.E. First”:\\n• “S.A.F.E. First” is at core of the strategy, developed as a\\npersonal reminder to pause and reflect on safety before\\nbeginning any task. (Self-check, Activity check, Facility check,\\nEnvironment check).\\n• Top five hazards, regularly reviewed to prevent serious\\naccidents.\\n• Five guiding principles, set the expected Health and Safety\\nbehaviors.\\n• Four strategic priorities, which have been identified as strong\\nlevers to deliver the Schneider Electric Policy.\\nThere is also a monthly Global Health and Safety steering\\ncommittee to share Health and Safety performance vs. targets and\\nHealth and Safety program deployment, with the Regional and\\nOrganizational Health and Safety VP’s.\\nThe 2024 plan covered programs related to safe driving, reducing\\ncut accidents, machine safety, and Health and Safety leadership\\ntraining for frontline managers.\\nLocal action plans, managed by each region, complement the\\nglobal plan, and includes the improvements identified by the\\nEnvironment Health and Safety Assessment (EHSA) deployment,\\nthe ISO 45001 implementation, and the safety culture assessment.\\nThe safety culture assessment has evolved into a program called\\n“Safer Future”, which includes a safety climate survey, which is\\ninternationally known as NOSACQ50. In 2024 this safety\\nquestionnaire has been deployed for the first time to all Schneider\\nElectric employees globally. The results are analyzed at local and\\nglobal level, helping to identify action plans to improve the safety\\nculture maturity. The employee engagement in the 2024 safety\\nsurvey was 46% which exceeded the 2024 ambition of 40%.\\nIn 2024 Schneider Electric has deployed a new global safety\\nsoftware solution, which collects incidents, near miss, HiPoS, and\\nsafety observations, tracks actions related to incident audits and\\nimprovement programs. It is accessible by all Schneider Electric’s\\nemployees, as well as contractors, and visitors, allowing them to\\nfully engage in the safety program.\\nThe Health and Safety intranet portal is used by employees to find\\nHealth & Safety directives, programs, valuable practices, hazard\\nawareness information, and technical webinars calendar, allowing\\nemployees to enhance their health and safety competency.\\nEach quarter, Schneider Electric publishes key topics, “Quarterly\\nH&S Spotlights”, to raise awareness of workplace health and safety\\nthrough training materials, posters, employee videos, and\\nsupported by a quarterly video message from Schneider Electric’s\\ntop leaders. Schneider Electric engages employees by using the\\ninternal social media tool, “Engage”, to post health and safety\\nupdates, interact with the community, and allowing Schneider\\nElectric to collect feedback from employees. Schneider Electric\\nalso encourages employees to report safety opportunities, which\\nare translated into risk reduction actions and engage employees in\\nthe health and safety program.\\nThe implementation of improvement actions linked to safety\\nopportunities is monitored. A risk reduction initiative has led to the\\ndrafting of a code of good practice for R&D and offices. This code\\ndescribes the practical measures that R&D sites and offices must\\ntake to reduce risks. These measures will be incorporated into the\\nSchneider Electric Safety Trust Standard, which will monitor\\ncompliance against safety standards through an internal audit\\nprogram.\\nAnnual Environmental Health and Safety Assessments (EHSA): To\\nensure successful implementation of the Schneider Electric Health\\nand Safety strategy, annual EHSA are performed in industrial and\\ncustomer-facing sites worldwide, by the site Health and Safety\\nteam and validated by the regional Health and Safety specialist.\\nThis assessment is a global process which measures compliance\\nagainst Health and Safety directives and identifies improvement\\nopportunities and recognizes excellence in manufacturing and\\nlogistics locations.\\nAll Schneider Electric sites prepare a Health and Safety legal\\nregister, audit themselves against the required regulations and\\nimplement actions to close the gaps. The full process is audited\\nevery three years as part of the ISO 45001 which is implemented\\non all industrial sites and is externally audited by an accredited\\nbody. The key elements of certification to ISO 45001 includes\\nannual site management review and internal site audit program,\\nand external audit program at site and corporate level.\\nManagement of hazardous substances is also audited as part of\\nthe ISO 45001. Engineering controls such as ventilation, enclosure\\nof hazardous substances, and regular maintenance of equipment\\nand extraction systems are control measures implemented to\\ncontrol the risk. Safety Data Sheets and other information on\\nhazardous substances are made available to employees and\\nincluded in the work area training. A new software tool to manage\\nSafety Data Sheets and reduce risk associated with hazardous\\nsubstances has been deployed to pilot countries in 2024. Health\\nsurveillance of workers exposed to hazardous substances are\\nimplemented to ensure the control measures are working and the\\nemployees are working in a safe and healthy environment. When\\nthe hazardous substances cannot be fully controlled with\\nengineering controls personal protective equipment is provided\\nto employees.\\nGlobal Risk Consultants perform loss prevention audits for\\nindustrial sites to ensure that the required standards for fire\\nprevention and emergency planning are in place.\\nTargets and metrics\\nHealth and Safety performance results\\nIn 2020, Schneider set a five-year safety ambition related to SSE\\n#14 to reduce the Medical Incident Rate (MIR) to 0.38 by 2025,\\nfrom a 0.79 baseline in 2019. The MIR is the number of work-related\\nmedical incidents (including injuries and occupational illnesses)\\nmultiplied by one million hours (average hours of 500 employees\\nworking for one calendar year) divided by the total hours worked.\\nWork-related injuries and occupational illnesses requiring medical\\ntreatment are included. Medical Incidents, where the injured party\\nrequires hospital treatment for more than 24 hours, are classified\\nas serious.\\nRead more on the methodology of SSE in\\nsection 2.4.1.2 on pages 316 to 321.\\nIn 2024, 197 medical incidents were recorded, translating to a MIR\\nperformance of 0.60, equivalent to a 24% progress of the 2021-\\n2025 program. The 2024 MIR has increased by 17% compared to\\n2023, of which 4 of the Medical Incidents were classified as\\nserious, without any employee fatalities. Of the 197 medical\\nincidents three were work related ill health incidents, connected\\nwith industrial ergonomics.\\nAs a result of all the health and safety programs deployed over the\\nlast 8 years, Schneider Electric has been very successful in\\nreducing incident severity as measured by the Lost-Time Day Rate\\n(LTDR) reduction to 9.1 lost days per incident, representing a\\nreduction of 17% compared to 2020.\\nIn addition, sustainability statements (CSRD) requirements cover a)\\nPercentage of people in its own workforce who are covered by\\nhealth and safety management system based on legal\\nrequirements and (or) recognized standards or guidelines, b) Rate\\nof recordable work-related accidents for own workforce, c) Number\\nof fatalities in own workforce as result of work-related injuries and\\nwork-related ill health, d) Number of fatalities as result of work-\\nrelated injuries and work-related ill health of other workers working\\non undertaking’s sites.\\nCompared to the SSE, sustainability statements (CSRD) are\\nincluding more sites and include only Schneider Electric\\nemployees, as defined by the text.\\n43% of employees are working in Schneider Electric sites with ISO\\n45001 certification and are covered by a health and safety\\nmanagement system. The rate of recordable work-related\\naccidents for own workforce was 0.54, connected with 168\\nwork-related accidents. There were no work-related injuries and\\nwork-related ill health fatalities in Schneider Electric’s own\\nworkforce in 2024. One Schneider Electric contractor fatality\\noccurred in India while a contractor was installing solar panels and\\nfell through a roof skylight.\\nIn 2024 we have developed a code of practice on R&D and Office\\nSafety. This code of practice will be translated to the Schneider\\nElectric Safety Trust Standard. This Safety Trust Standard will\\nmonitor compliance against these standards through an internal\\naudit program.\\nRecognition and awards\\nSchneider Electric North America has won the Operational\\nExcellence Achievement Award given to organizations with 50 or\\nmore locations achieving Occupational Excellence.\\nSchneider Electric UK & Ireland has been awarded the RoSPA\\nGold Medal (seven consecutive Golds) Award for health and safety\\nperformance and the RoSPA Fleet Safety Gold Medal (eight\\nconsecutive Golds) Award for managing occupational road risk.\\nSchneider Electric India, China, and Thailand have been\\nrecognized for their safety performance delivering customer\\nworksite projects.\\nSchneider Electric Canada has been awarded a partnership in\\ninjury reduction.\\nSchneider Electric Perú received an award from the insurance\\ncompany RIMAC for its excellence in the category “Best\\nComprehensive Occupational Risk Management”.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2.2.3.1.4 Equal treatment\\nImpacts, risks and opportunities\\nEqual treatment and opportunities\\nPositive Impact Improve employees’ well-being and\\nfeeling of belonging\\nWith continuous global and local political, economic, and social\\nchallenges in the post-pandemic era, inclusion and care is needed\\nmore than ever. This, paired with the rising importance of ESG\\ntopics for organizations, stakeholders, and investors, puts Inclusion\\n& Care at the forefront of Schneider Electric’s business and people\\npriorities.\\nWe live in a more and more polarized world, where megatrends\\ncreate more inequities as well as opportunities for just energy and\\ndigital transitions. There will be no energy and digital transitions\\nwithout bringing everyone along. Companies must play their part in\\nthe inclusion of all in their ecosystem to reach their growth\\nambitions while reducing inequalities. The regulatory environment\\nbecomes more stringent, and the landscape is more and more\\ndifferent by geography. As an Impact Company, Schneider Electric\\nmust adapt to this context to remain a leader in ESG. This means\\nexpanding its inclusion and care by design journey to create\\nimpact for customers, people, and the entire ecosystem.\\nInclusion & Care is a marker of Schneider Electric and can continue\\nto be a unique competitive advantage if tackled properly and\\ngenuinely. Schneider has identified three main risks around those\\ntopics:\\n• Workforce diversity compared to the markets we serve – if our\\ndiversity is not mirroring the markets and customers we serve,\\nwe are at risk of not attracting and retaining the best talent and\\nultimately not meeting all customer needs.\\n• Employee engagement, performance, retention, and corporate\\nreputation are at risk when all employees do not have the same\\nopportunity to grow and advance because of a lack of fairness\\nand equity in people processes.\\n• The regulatory environment becomes more stringent, and the\\nlandscape is more and more different by geography.\\nOn the flip side, the opportunities are huge when inclusion and\\ncare are by design in all processes and behaviors:\\n• A Boston Consulting Group report shows that companies with\\nmore diverse management teams have reported 19% higher\\nrevenues due to innovation.\\n• A study from Harvard Business Review shows that employees\\nreporting a feeling of belonging, where they feel included and\\ncared for are 3.5 times more engaged.\\nSchneider Electric defines its strategy taking into consideration\\nthose risks and opportunities, internal and external trends, insights\\nand feedback from leaders and employees.\\nSchneider Electric believes this leads to greater engagement,\\nperformance, and innovation, and creates access to the best\\npossible talent pools around the globe.', 'S1_B': 'In the Decent Workplace section, the level of Human Rights\\nrisks for Migrant Workers was revaluated in 2023, as a\\nconsequence of the increased migration flows. The origins\\nof these displacements are multiple, from climate change to\\nconflicts or economic hardship. They are not a consequence\\nof Schneider Electric’s policies. However, Schneider Electric,\\nlike other companies, is confronted by that reality. In 2024,\\nfollowing the reevaluation, this risk remains a top priority.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSchneider Electric’s Risk Management framework considers the\\nGroup’s dependencies, as well as impacts, on the use of natural,\\nhuman, and social resources to determine several of the risk\\ncategories included in the Enterprise Risk Management process.\\nThe risks identified are ranked by a risk score, which combines the\\nprobability of occurrence over a three-to five-year period (ranging\\nfrom improbable to probable) with the magnitude of the potential\\neffects to determine the level of risk which the Group is exposed to\\n(ranging from very low to high).

Legal risks include\\npotential fines from lawsuits, duty of care infringement, and\\nnon-compliance with mandatory benefit requirements and\\nworkplace violations, which could lead to a loss of business.\\nReputational risks arise from NGO demands on freedom of\\nassociation and media exposure. Social negotiations may increase\\noperational costs. Conversely, the Group recognizes the\\nopportunity to enhance its reputation and attract talent by\\nmaintaining decent working conditions, which is crucial for\\nnurturing and retaining talent within the organization.\\nEmployee health and safety\\nThe Group is aware of the legal risks associated with potential fines\\ndue to non-compliance with health and safety regulations. Civil\\nrisks may emerge from potential claims by employees or\\ncustomers, and reputational risks could result from any damage to\\nthe Group’s image, particularly when incidents involve employees\\nworking on client sites.\\nEqual treatment and opportunities for all\\nThe Group sees a business opportunity in increasing employee\\nengagement, which can lead to improved productivity rates. Not\\ninvesting in skills development poses a risk, as the organization\\nmay lack the necessary competencies to meet business needs.\\nBeing perceived as an ethical company enhances the Group’s\\nemployer brand and aids in attracting and retaining talents.\\nHowever, there is a legal risk associated with potential lawsuits\\narising from discrimination cases.\\nTraining and skills development\\nInvesting in training and skills development is seen as a key factor\\nin employee attraction and retention, contributing to productivity\\nimprovement.

The\\nprogram design and operation are influenced by the Group’s risk profile, business model, organizational structure, and culture.\\n\\n---\\n\\nRisk categories\\nFor a granular assessment of the risk level and the magnitude of the\\nimpact on Schneider Electric’s ecosystem, the Group has identified\\nmore than 60 natures of risks relating to different risk areas, which\\ncan be grouped into four risk categories.\\nHuman rights:\\n• Decent workplace\\n• Health and safety\\n\\n---\\n\\nHuman rights\\nForced labor, migrant workers\\nAccording to the 2021 Global Estimates of Modern Slavery,\\napproximately 28 million people are estimated to be in forced labor,\\na number alarmingly increasing since 2016. 63% of all forced labor\\n(17 million people) is estimated to be imposed by private actors.\\nThe report estimates that services (excluding domestic work), and\\nmanufacturing are the sectors most exposed, accounting for\\nrespectively 32% and 19% of total forced labor. The report also\\nidentifies that for manufacturing, most forced labor cases occur in\\nproduction in the lower tiers of domestic or global supply chains.\\nThis analysis shows that there could be risks of forced labor in the\\nlower tiers of Schneider Electric’s supply chain, especially for\\nmigrant workers. Although cases have not been identified during\\ninternal or supplier audits, Schneider Electric is committed to\\nfurther investigate and better mitigate this risk.\\nWorking hours, mental health\\nThe second category of risk in this section is linked to long working\\nhours, work pressure and the consequent psycho-social and\\nmental health risks. Here, the risk is rather well captured, both\\ninternally and at suppliers and contractor’s place of operations.\\nFollowing the COVID year, this risk has been increasing in a rather\\nregular way. However, the set of actions deployed to reduce its\\nnegative impacts has also been enlarged, especially within\\nSchneider Electric’s own operations.\\n\\n---\\n\\nComparison of the 2024 analysis with 2023\\nIn 2024, to converge towards the requirements of the CSRD, the\\nrisk analysis performed has further detailed two dimensions:\\nseverity and likelihood. The calculation of the matrix has therefore\\nbeen improved, leading to slight modifications in the ratings of\\ncertain scores, although these risks have not fundamentally\\nchanged compared to last year.\\nYet, following items have evolved:\\n• In the Decent Workplace section, the level of Human Rights\\nrisks for Migrant Workers was revaluated in 2023, as a\\nconsequence of the increased migration flows. The origins\\nof these displacements are multiple, from climate change to\\nconflicts or economic hardship. They are not a consequence\\nof Schneider Electric’s policies. However, Schneider Electric,\\nlike other companies, is confronted by that reality. In 2024,\\nfollowing the reevaluation, this risk remains a top priority.\\n\\n---\\n\\nKey Topics Risk Categories Policies Implemented and Mitigation Actions Pages\\nSchneider Electric sites\\nHuman rights Decent workplace See section 2.2.3.1 “Great people make Schneider Electric a great company (ESRS S1)”\\nfor more details on the deployment of decent working conditions, health, safety, and\\nhuman rights actions on Schneider Electric sites and section 2.2.3.2.2 “Policy framework\\nguiding sustainability in the value chain – Human Rights Policy”.

In its Group\\nHuman Rights Policy, Schneider Electric reaffirms those\\nprinciples as the basis for a regular dialogue between management\\nand employees. To that purpose, Schneider Electric respects the\\nindividual right of its employees to freely join, participate in, or quit\\nlabor organizations to assert and defend their interests.\\n\\n---\\n\\nPolicy\\nSchneider Electric firmly believes that earning a living wage is a\\nfundamental human right and an essential element of decent work.\\nThis commitment is included in our Human Rights Policy and Trust\\nCharter, guiding our efforts to ensure that all employees receive at\\nor above a living wage to meet their families’ basic needs which\\ninclude food, housing, sanitation, education, healthcare, clothing,\\ntransportation, and communication plus discretionary income for a\\ngiven local standard of living.\\nSchneider Electric conducts annual living wage gap analysis since\\n2018. Starting in 2021, the Group committed to paying 100% of\\nemployees at least a living wage as part of Schneider Sustainability\\nEssentials (SSE #20). The company works with the expert\\nconsultant Fair Wage Network to ensure compliance. An external\\ncompany provides limited assurance to ensure year-over-year\\ncompliance with this commitment. The SSE #20 reporting protocol\\nis accessible to employees via the intranet and has been approved\\nby the Senior-Vice President, Total Rewards and Performance.\\nAction plan\\nCollaborating with Fair Wage Network since 2022 allowed the\\nGroup to improve geographical coverage, develop a dynamic\\nweb-based living wage benchmark, and initiate an independent\\nreview and certification of the living wage gap analysis. Schneider\\nElectric was certified in March 2024, by the Fair Wage Network,\\nbeing qualified as a “Living Wage Employer” for a second\\nconsecutive time, valid until December 31, 2025.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSchneider Electric is committed to the United Nations Free and\\nEqual Standards of Conduct for Business on Tackling\\nDiscrimination against LGBT+ People, standing up for equal rights\\nand fair treatment for LGBT+ people everywhere. Across the globe,\\nSchneider Electric has also made public statements of support to\\nadvance LGBT+ inclusion. By adopting these standards, the Group\\npledges to respect and stand up for the human rights of LGBT+\\nworkers, customers, and members of the public; to support our\\nLGBT+ employees, further build inclusion in the workplace, and to\\nprevent discrimination, including workplace discrimination, against\\nLGBT+ people.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSponsoring and donations: To ensure legal and ethical\\noperations in sponsorship activities and mitigate corruption and\\nreputational risks, comprehensive risk screenings are conducted.\\nAdditionally, Schneider Electric’s Philanthropy program is governed\\nby strong practices, including thorough due diligence to assess\\ndonation-related risks in compliance with laws and local contexts.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSchneider Electric’s first priority is ensuring that the company and\\nits partners uphold human rights for everyone, including decent\\nwork standards and a social label for products. Following the\\nupdate of its Human Rights Policy in 2022, Schneider published\\nguidelines to protect the dignity of migrant workers.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSSE #20: 100% of employees paid at least a living\\nwage\\nIn line with its Human Rights Policy and Trust Charter, Schneider\\nElectric believes earning a living wage is a basic human right.\\nSchneider Electric is committed to paying 100% of employees at or\\nabove the living wage to meet their families’ basic needs. By basic\\nneeds, the Group considers basic household expenditures (food,\\nhousing, clothing, sanitation, education, healthcare, transport),\\nplus discretionary income for a given local standard of living.\\nThere is no universal benchmark or methodology on how to\\ncalculate a living wage, which is why Schneider Electric has been\\nworking with an external consultant since 2018 to calculate living\\nwages for all its locations worldwide. To calculate a living wage, the\\nexternal consultant estimates the basic household expenditures of\\nemployees, as well as the number of persons earning a wage in a\\n“typical” household based on various sources of cost of living and\\nmacroeconomic data (national statistics, Organisation for\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD), United Nations\\nagencies, etc.).\\nTo measure compliance with the living wage, a gap analysis is\\nconducted every year post salary review for all our Schneider\\nElectric employees treated as permanent workforce. All employees\\nemployed by fully integrated entities, with open-ended or fixed-\\nterm contracts, whether full-time or part-time, are considered part\\nof the permanent workforce. The Reward team centrally compiles\\nand analyses total employee remuneration data (base salary and\\nallowances; if applicable for a country, variable elements were\\nexcluded this year) to compare it with the agreed living wage.\\nEmployees are benchmarked to their work location living wage. To\\ncalculate employee remuneration, the Reward team uses data\\navailable in its global HRIS system, as well as local payroll.\\nFor final reporting of the year-end results, Schneider Electric can\\ndisclose a final score that considers living wage gaps closed by\\ncountries until the end of the year after they have been identified.\\nPwC provided limited assurance on this indicator.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSchneider Sustainability External and Relative Index – SSERI (25%)\\nThe Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index measures the long-term sustainability performance of the Group in terms of\\nrelative performance, through a combination of external indices: (i) DJSI World which covers three dimensions: economic, environmental,\\nand social; (ii) Euronext Vigeo which covers environment, community involvement, business behavior, human rights, corporate\\ngovernance, and human resources; (iii) Ecovadis which covers four dimensions: environment, labor and human rights, sustainable\\nprocurement, and ethics; and (iv) CDP Climate Change which covers climate change, water, and forests and represents a major\\nreference for climate change leadership globally. The different rating achieved by Schneider Electric in 2022, 2023, and 2024 in those\\nindexes resulted in an achievement rate of the SSERI of 23.96% (out of 25%).\\n\\n---\\n\\nGlobal and local external partnerships\\nSchneider Electric works with over 300 local and international organizations and associations on economic, social, and environmental\\nissues to foster sustainability in cooperation with various players.

As a Global\\ncompany, Schneider Electric believes that its responsibility goes\\nbeyond compliance with local and international regulations and is\\ntherefore committed to conducting its business ethically,\\nsustainably and in a responsible manner. As the Group’s borders\\nare expanding, its activities and impact being global, its social\\nresponsibilities are growing.\\nIn the context of transformative growth, it is the Company’s\\nambition to maintain the highest confidence and engagement from\\nall employees, sharing vision and getting insights directly from\\nemployees, or through their representatives, depending of the legal\\nframework, to ensure a fair two-way dialogue everywhere. Policies\\nand agreements in place define the framework for this two-way\\ndialogue.\\nIn addition, social dialogue at Schneider Electric includes also the\\ncontinuous listening culture with the annual survey “OneVoice”, sent\\nto all employees, allowing them to share their feedback on a\\nvoluntary basis, on key topics related to their workplace and\\nexperience appreciation.\\nIn its Trust Charter (Schneider Electric’s Code of Conduct),\\nSchneider commits to follow all the requirements to build and\\nsustain fruitful and mutually beneficial relationships between labor\\norganizations and management, in accordance with local\\nregulations, in every country where it operates. In its Group\\nHuman Rights Policy, Schneider Electric reaffirms those\\nprinciples as the basis for a regular dialogue between management\\nand employees. To that purpose, Schneider Electric respects the\\nindividual right of its employees to freely join, participate in, or quit\\nlabor organizations to assert and defend their interests.\\nRead more in section 2.2.1.1.3 on pages 102 to 107.\\nRead more on the Human Rights Policy in section\\n2.2.3.2.2 on pages 237 and 238.\\nSubsequently, Schneider Electric guarantees that any Employee\\nwishing to do so, shall be protected against any internal measure\\nlimiting his or her freedom of association, such as discrimination of\\nany kind, pay loss, or dismissal.\\nIn case of any issue, employees are encouraged to report, using\\nthe internal reporting tool for unethical behavior or misconduct,\\ncalled the “Trust Line”.\\nSchneider Electric also values the importance of dialogue with\\nfreely appointed employee representatives, employee\\nrepresentative bodies (e.g., works councils or employee forums), or\\norganizations (like trade unions), and supports collective\\nbargaining. In addition, to provide multi-cultural social dialogue on\\ntransnational projects, the highest level of Leadership is engaged;\\nas an example, the seat of European Works Council Chairperson is\\nheld by an HR Senior Vice-President, demonstrating Schneider’s\\ninvolvement in that two-way dialogue.\\nIn addition to the above, the Group hardwires its principles in the\\nway it manages social dialogue in countries. On transnational\\ntopics, engagement with employee representatives from European\\ncountries is described in the agreement signed in 2014. It contains\\nengagement rules for the information, consultation and\\nparticipation of Schneider Electric employees and representatives\\nin Europe. This agreement describes the composition of the\\nEuropean Works Council, as well as the various roles of its\\nmembers (Chairperson, Core Council, Secretary, plenary\\nmembers) and the cadence of engagement, i.e. the yearly meeting\\nwith the plenary members, in addition to the quarterly meeting with\\nthe Core Council, as per circumstances. Each year, the level of\\nparticipation from top leaders of the Company, as well as the strong\\nparticipation rate of all employee representatives from Europe,\\ndemonstrates common interest in this dialogue.\\nAction plan\\nConcretely, social dialogue at Schneider Electric is managed at\\ncountry level by HR leaders with the employee representative\\nbodies and/or unions, in compliance with local legislation. Some\\nexamples of social dialogue management in key regions where the\\nCompany operates can be found below.\\nAt transnational level, social dialogue is managed with the\\nEuropean Works Council which comprises employee\\nrepresentatives covering European Economic Area Countries, in\\naddition to UK and Switzerland, as per agreement described\\nabove.\\nWhile changing the corporate form of its parent company,\\nSchneider Electric SA, into a European company (Société\\neuropéenne), Schneider Electric negotiated then an agreement\\nwith employee representatives of European countries about the\\ninvolvement of these countries’ employees in the Company’s\\ndecision-making process, thus reaffirming its intention to provide\\nregular, efficient, multi-cultural, and innovative social dialogue at\\nthe European level, taking into account the voice of employees on\\nthe transnational projects of the Company related to its\\ndevelopments and economic, financial, and social strategies at\\nEuropean level.\\nIn addition, Schneider joined the Global Deal initiative in 2017,\\nwhich promotes social dialogue and sound industrial relations, as\\neffective means for achieving decent work and inclusive growth.\\nSince 2021, social dialogue is included into the Group’s social\\nreporting on Decent Work. Local HR teams report on a yearly basis\\non the presence of employee representation bodies in their\\ncountries and the percentage of employees covered by collective\\nagreements.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSSE #24: 75% employee engagement score\\nA high Employee Engagement Index is linked to higher sales\\ngrowth, higher operating income, and ultimately higher customer\\nsatisfaction and loyalty toward the Company. This index is\\ncalculated once a year through a survey called OneVoice, sent to\\n100% of the Group employees, and serves a starting point to adapt\\nits people strategy and action plans.\\nThe computation of this KPI includes all Schneider employees\\ntreated as permanent workforce (i.e., open-ended and fixed-term\\ncontracts over 3 months), thus excluding interns or third-party\\ncontractors.\\nThe Kincentric employee engagement model is used, composed of\\n6 questions, 2 per item (SAY, STAY, STRIVE), scored on a 6-point\\nscale by employees:\\n• Employee Engagement Index: is the percentage of people\\nfor which the average of the six questions is equal or higher\\nthan 4.5;\\n• Employee Disengagement: percentage of people for which the\\naverage of the six questions is equal or lower than 3.5;\\n• Neutral: is the percentage of people for which the average of the\\nsix questions is scored between 3.5 and 4.5.\\nPwC provided limited assurance on this indicator.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Group listens to\\nemployees through a\\nnumber of different\\nchannels, both formally\\nand informally.

Discrimination occurs when someone is treated\\nunfairly due to personal characteristics, such as disabilities, age,\\nrace, gender, religion, sexual orientation, marital status, and more.\\nThis policy is not aligned with any international standards due to the\\nabsence of a comprehensive global framework on the prevention of\\nharassment and discrimination in the workplace. It is owned by the\\nGroup HR Compliance Officer and approved by Chief Governance\\nOfficer and Secretary General and Chief Human Resources Officer.\\nIt also reinforces employees’ rights and responsibilities, notably\\nregarding anti-retaliation.

In addition, in 2024, the Group\\nhas deployed a “Prevent and manage harassment and\\ndiscrimination” for Human Resources Business Partners and\\nmanagers, and some specific trainings were deployed in line with\\nlocal initiatives to prevent sexual harassment in specific countries\\n(e.g. India, Germany, Austria, Switzerland).\\nTo enhance workplace-related alert handling, the Group introduced\\nupdated e-learning in 2024 for its HR internal investigators,\\nensuring impartiality and consistent practices. The number of HR\\ninvestigators was increased in 2024 to bolster investigation\\ncapabilities across all regions. Workshops have been also\\nconducted for internal investigators in many geographies, and a\\npilot mediation program was launched in France. In addition, HR\\nprocesses were strengthened through background check updates\\nto the Personnel Management Security Policy, enhanced Hiring\\nGuidelines with a focus on compliance (including re-hire\\nprocesses), and the creation of a new Ethics & Compliance\\nquestionnaire for the Interview Guide Tool.\\nIn 2024, a dedicated communication plan was carried out,\\npromoting the Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Policy and\\nraising awareness. In addition, Schneider Electric encourages the\\nSpeak Up mindset to allow employees and stakeholders to report\\nany violations of the Group’s ethical standards or any workplace-\\nrelated concerns.\\nPay Equity policy\\nThe principles of fairness, equity, ethics, and transparency are\\nfully embedded in the Company values.

To ensure this, the\\nGroup aims to provide equal opportunities to all and makes talent\\ndecisions based on skills and qualifications for the role irrespective\\nof any other identifying characteristics. This includes visible and\\nnon-visible dimensions of diversity, including cognition, experience,\\neducation, gender and gender identity, age, nationality and\\nethnicity, color, physical appearance, sexual orientation, disability\\nstatus, religious, cultural and socio-economic background, life\\nexperience, location, and more, depending on local requirements.\\nPay Equity strategy\\nIn support of advancing Pay Equity, the Company executes a holistic strategy to improve and maintain fair compensation while preventing\\ncreation of new pay gaps.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn execution of the holistic Pay Equity strategy, the Group closely\\nmonitors the salary offers of new recruits, salary adjustments from\\nemployee promotions, and other employee career movements.\\nContinuous monitoring of pay equity status is made possible by Pay\\nEquity Dashboard and its resulting analytics. Additionally,\\nmanagers and HR professionals are trained to be unbiased and\\nmindful of every pay decision they make. Prevention of new pay\\ngaps is supported by the Group’s “Fair Pay Simulator” which was\\ndeployed to HR in 2023. The simulator provides visibility to pay\\nequity positioning, enabling better pay decisions for recruit offers,\\npromotions, and other salary adjustments.\\nSince 2018, pay equity has been an integral part of the annual\\nGlobal Salary Review processes, to address identified gaps. In the\\n2024 campaign, there have been notable enhancements to the\\nuser experience, specifically benefiting managers in relation to pay\\nequity, further improving the process.\\nPay equity advocacy is another key aspect of the Group’s Pay\\nEquity strategy.

In 2024, the Chief Governance Officer & Secretary\\nGeneral, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer, joined\\nas a new member of the Committee.\\n• The Group Disciplinary Committee levies sanctions and\\nremediation actions on serious non-compliance cases to\\nguarantee a fair and transparent disciplinary policy upon\\nrequest of the GOCC. The Group Disciplinary Committee is\\ncomposed of the following members: Chief Governance Officer\\n& Secretary General, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief\\nCompliance Officer (secretary of the Committee), Chief\\nBusiness Legal Officer, and one rotating member\\n\\n---\\n\\nCorrective actions\\nDeficiencies in the implementation of the Trust programs –\\npotentially reported through whistleblowing – are analyzed to\\nidentify their cause and remedy them with appropriate measures,\\nwhich can take the form of:\\n• Disciplinary measures decided by the relevant managers\\ntogether with Human Resources, or by the Group Disciplinary\\nCommittee for the most sensitive alerts based on the findings of\\nan investigation and depending on local disciplinary policies\\nand law;\\n• Remediation measures (such as launching a specific audit,\\nreviewing a process, or performing training);\\n• External actions (such as entering civil litigation or similar\\nlegal proceedings).\\nIn 2024, Schneider Electric has published its first Group\\nDisciplinary Policy, which aims to achieve and maintain\\ntransparency and consistency by establishing a framework for\\nDisciplinary Actions in case of violations of the Trust Charter,\\nassociated Group policies, and applicable laws and regulations.\\nIt supports the guidance and recommendations provided by\\ncompetent authorities and bodies regarding Disciplinary Actions\\n\\n---\\n\\nSchneider Electric employees have a responsibility to report\\npotential unethical behaviors, as set out in the Whistleblowing\\nPolicy. To voluntarily report a potential violation of laws and\\nregulations, and/or of the Group’s Trust Charter and Group policies,\\nwhistleblowers can use all reporting channels available, regardless\\nwhether they are employees, contractors, or external stakeholders\\n(suppliers, subcontractors, customers, business agents, etc.)\\nAt Schneider Electric, stakeholders, either internal or external, may\\nreport concerns either by contacting an appropriate person in the\\nGroup (manager, Human Resources business partner, Legal\\nCounsel, or Compliance Officer) and/or by using the Trust Line,\\nSchneider Electric’s whistleblowing system. The latter is available\\nonline globally, at all times, in 27 languages, and protects the\\nanonymity of the whistleblower (unless there is legislation to the\\ncontrary). In compliance with local legislation, this system is\\nprovided by an external, impartial third-party company and\\nproposes alert categories, a questionnaire, and an information\\nexchange protocol between the person issuing the alert and the\\nperson responsible for the case management.\\nSchneider Electric’s Whistleblowing Policy is available publicly\\non www.se.com\\nActions and resources\\nCase management: a structured process led by Ethics & Compliance\\n1.

The triage of misconduct reports is primarily\\nmanaged by the Regional Compliance Officer. Upon receipt of\\na concern, the Officer evaluates its validity based on predefined\\ncriteria outlined in the Whistleblowing Policy. If the concern\\nqualifies as a valid alert, it is promptly escalated for thorough\\ninvestigation. However, if the concern does not meet the criteria,\\nit is closed, and the reporter is directed to the relevant organization\\nfor assistance. In cases where the Officer requires further\\ninformation to conduct the triage effectively, they may request\\nadditional details from the reporter. However, if there is no response\\nfrom the reporter after two reminders and/or three weeks following\\nthe receipt of the concern, the case may be closed.\\nFurthermore, collaboration with partner organizations such as\\nHuman Resources, Internal Audit and Finance is integral to the\\nprocess, especially in cases where their expertise and involvement\\nare necessary for a comprehensive resolution.\\nOnce a concern is identified as an alert, the Regional Compliance\\nOfficer undertakes two critical actions:\\n• Firstly, to determine the type of alert based on the definitions\\noutlined in the Whistleblowing Policy; and\\n• Secondly, to classify the case according to the severity\\ncriteria specified in an Appendix of the Whistleblowing Policy.\\nThe Regional Compliance Officer does so with impartiality\\nand confidentiality.\\nDepending on this classification, low and medium cases are\\nmanaged by the relevant Regional Compliance Officer at the\\nregional level, while high and critical cases are overseen at global\\nlevel by a member of the Group Operational Compliance\\nCommittee. It is important to note that the classification of a case\\nmay evolve during the investigation process.\\nSubsequently, the appointed Case Manager takes charge of\\ndeciding the investigative approach, either by leading it directly,\\nassigning a dedicated investigation team, or appointing an external\\ninvestigator. In order to properly manage all situations, the Case\\nManagement & Investigation Policy sets out rules to make this\\ndecision with impartiality in order to make sure decision-making\\nis done objectively and in autonomy from chain of management\\ninvolved in prevention and detection of corruption or bribery\\n\\n---\\n\\nSchneider Electric’s Whistleblowing Policy provides for the\\nprotection of the reporter, reported person, witnesses, and other\\ninvolved people by highlighting rights and responsibilities of people\\ninvolved. It meets the legal obligations specified by the EU\\nWhistleblowing Directive 2019/1937. People protection is\\nemphasized on, in particular:\\n• A procedure to ensure Schneider Electric’s zero-tolerance\\npolicy against retaliation by prohibiting retaliation or other\\ndiscrimination, and a prompt, independent and objective case\\nmanagement investigation;\\n• A set of protection and care measures that can be offered\\nduring investigation, if needed and as per local legislation, such\\nas: security measures (distancing), accommodations, flexible\\ntime management, change of function/service, and\\npsychological support;\\n• A possibility of internal or external mediation to help rebuild\\nrespectful collaboration;\\n• Impartiality rules guaranteed with the appropriate level of case\\nmanagement when a top leader is the reported employee, and\\nby the prevention of conflict of interest, notably ensuring that\\ninvestigators are separate from change of management involved\\nin the Ethics & Compliance program when necessary.\\nFollowing investigative findings, in the event of a confirmed case,\\ncertain corrective actions may be implemented, which may include\\ndisciplinary measures. Notably, in 2024, Schneider Electric\\nintroduced its first Group Disciplinary Policy, outlining the rules for\\ndisciplinary measures\\n\\n---\\n\\nTo measure the effectiveness of the Trust Line, Schneider Electric\\ncreated Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) #7 and added a\\nquestion to its annual employee engagement survey, OneVoice:\\n“I can report an instance of unethical conduct without fear”. In\\n2021, 81% of employees surveyed answered “yes”. Since then, the\\nGroup is working to increase this measurement by 10 points by\\n2025 as part of the SSI. In 2024, 83% of employees surveyed\\nanswered “yes” which constitutes an improvement of +2 points over\\na three-year period\\n\\n---\\n\\nAchievements 2024:83% of employees\\nare confident to\\nreport unethical\\nbehavior\\n\\n---\\n\\nHaving committed employees is essential for the Company to\\nperform well and align with the Group’s strategy. Employee\\nfeedback from a yearly survey is gathered and utilized to create\\naction plans throughout the organization. This process encourages\\nleaders to work with their teams to develop these action plans,\\nfostering the collaborative communication necessary to shape the\\nfuture workplace.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe survey includes two open ended questions, where employees\\ncan submit their comments on what makes them proud to work at\\nSchneider Electric and what they identify as areas of improvement.\\nThis allows employees to share their views on any topic, including\\nworking conditions\\n\\n---\\n\\nEngaged employees are key to enable the Company to be at its\\nbest and support the achievement of the Group strategy.\\nEmployees are invited to share their honest feedback through an\\nannual engagement survey, which measures ten key drivers,\\nincluding well-being, inclusion, recognition, and empowerment.\\nThrough the information collected, the Company gains greater\\nunderstanding of the views of employees, including areas of\\nstrength and improvement. Insights are used to inform action plans\\nacross the organization. Leaders are guided to co-create the\\nactions with their teams, reinforcing the dialogue needed to shape\\nthe workplace of tomorrow.\\nThis process also contributes to the impacts, risks, and\\nopportunities mentioned in the beginning of this chapter.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn case of any issue, employees are encouraged to report, using\\nthe internal reporting tool for unethical behavior or misconduct,\\ncalled the “Trust Line”.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn some of the plants where there are no recognized unions, this\\nbargaining process is conducted with the elected representatives\\nfrom within the employees who form committees such as Welfare\\n(works committee). The Company also has strong engagement with\\nother committees such as Health & Safety, Canteen, Sports, and\\nTransport, including a special committee for women employees. In\\naddition, the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Committee, which is\\nfully compliant with the prevention of sexual harassment\\ngovernance as per local laws, comprises employees and external\\nwomen with specialist knowledge of the subject and with legal\\nbackgrounds. These committees provide a platform for employees\\nto present their concerns, collective grievances, and workplace-\\nrelated issues to management, and actions are initiated based on\\nthe recommendations of these committees. All employee\\nengagement programs are run through these committees with the\\nactive participation of every employee\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis comes in addition to our listening culture (One\\nVoice annual employee survey), our internal whistleblowing\\nplatform on potential unethical issue (Trust Line) and existing\\nDecent work program for our employees.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAt Schneider Electric, stakeholders may report potential violations\\nof the Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Policy either by\\ncontacting an appropriate person in the Group and/or by using\\nthe Trust Line, Schneider Electric’s whistleblowing system. In 2024,\\n51% of the closed, valid, and substantiated alerts reported\\nthrough whistleblowing, concerned discrimination, harassment,\\nand sexual harassment\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Human Rights Policy’s objective is to define the Group’s\\nposition on human rights along its value chain, including forced\\nlabor, health and safety, or working conditions. The Group both\\nstates in the document that “to the best of its knowledge, it refrains\\nfrom working with business partners that are using forced or\\ncompulsory labor in their operations” and that it “is committed to\\nensuring that human rights are respected not only in its own\\noperations but throughout its value chain. The Group considers that\\na company should seek to provide decent work not only to its own\\nemployees but the same should be extended to its value chain”.\\nIt also states Schneider Electric’s commitment to provide or support\\nremedy in case the Group has caused or contributed to a negative\\nimpact. The Human Rights Policy serves as a set of rules\\napplicable to its daily operations for Schneider Electric and\\nits employees.\\nThe policy is available in eight languages and applies to all\\nSchneider Electric affiliates. It is applicable to all Schneider Electric\\npermanent or temporary employees working on Group premises.\\nIt also aims to inspire external stakeholders. The policy provides a\\nframework and gives guidance to employees and teams on how to\\nbehave in their daily operations or when facing a specific situation.\\nSchneider Electric’s Human Rights Policy is available\\npublicly on www.se.com\\n\\n---\\n\\n5. Social dialogue\\nand workplace\\nrelations\\nEmployees should have the right to engage with management and collectively put across their concerns\\nand demands. Collective bargaining encourages workers to raise concerns in a timely manner, acts as a\\nbarometer and early warning system to assess worker satisfaction and reduces worker vulnerability.\\n\\n---\\n\\nDecent working\\nhours\\nExcessive working hours is a legal violation, often accepted as “necessary”. It is generally connected with\\nlow industrial wages and used as an excuse to not provide appropriate wages. Companies should review\\nand remediate excessive hours and should align with the legal and/or international requirements.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhistleblowing\\nAt Schneider Electric, stakeholders may report potential violations\\nof the Anti-Corruption Policy either by contacting an appropriate\\nperson in the Group and/or by using the Trust Line, Schneider\\nElectric’s whistleblowing system. In 2024, 11% of the closed, valid\\nand substantiated alerts reported through whistleblowing,\\nconcerned a violation of the Anti-Corruption Policy. Additionally, for\\nthe reporting year 2024, Schneider Electric was not convicted for\\nany violation of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSSI #7: Measure the level of confidence of our\\nemployees to report behaviors against our\\nprinciples of Trust\\nOur “Speak Up” mindset helps to maintain high standards, a strong\\nreputation, and a healthy and productive working environment, and\\nprotects Schneider Electric and its employees from multiple risks.\\nMisconduct situations will be less likely to occur if people,\\nemployees, and stakeholders feel safe to speak up about\\nconcerns, dilemmas, or issues in good faith, respectfully, and\\nwithout fear of retaliation.\\nOur Trust Charter and Ethics & Compliance program participate to\\ntransform this belief into practical actions, notably offering multiple\\nfair, neutral, and confidential reporting channels to our employees\\nto make them feel confident to report unethical conduct.\\nIn order to assess this KPI, the question “I can report an instance of\\nunethical conduct without fear” is annually asked to all Schneider\\nElectric employees in the OneVoice survey. The percentage of\\n“Agree” and “Strongly Agree” amongst the answers determines\\nthe level of confidence of Schneider Employees to report unethical\\nconduct. Responses are anonymized and aggregated for\\ncompliance purposes.\\nThis indicator was calculated for the first time in 2021 and reached\\nan 81/100 performance. This KPI is integrated to the SSI score\\ncomputation since 2022.\\nPwC provided limited assurance on this indicator\\n\\n---\\n\\nRisk monitoring and management\\nTo raise awareness about applicable competition laws and manage\\nareas of risk, Schneider Electric’s Competition Law Compliance\\nProgram is based on policies, guidelines and procedures,\\ne-learnings and in person trainings, internal controls and audits\\nand an internal reporting and whistleblowing mechanisms.\\nBoth the Group Competition Law Policy and the Competition Law\\nGuidelines have been translated into over 40 languages and are\\naccessible to all employees via Schneider Electric’s internal\\npolicy platform.\\nThe whistleblowing system of Trust Line for employees and external\\nstakeholders such as suppliers is managed to identify any\\ninappropriate practice or behavior with competitors or business\\npartners that may be reported.\\nFurthermore, internal controls and internal audit missions continue\\nto be reinforced on compliance risks, including in respect of\\ncompetition and antitrust risks.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhistleblowing – A global whistleblowing system, available to\\nemployees and external stakeholders, is also managed to\\ncombat this risk. In 2024, 1,922 employee and 347 external\\nstakeholder alerts have been received and managed through\\nfollow-up inquiries.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Group listens to\\nemployees through a\\nnumber of different\\nchannels, both formally\\nand informally. Three of\\nthe Board Directors are\\nemployees of the\\nCompany, appointed\\nthrough a formal\\ndesignation process.\\nThe Group runs\\nOneVoice internal\\nsurvey designed to\\nmeasure employee\\nsatisfaction and\\nengagement; the\\nGroup also recognizes\\nthe importance of\\ndialogue and engages\\nwith the local work\\ncouncils on\\ncompensation matters\\non a regular basis\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs part of the Speak Up mindset, and as developed in the\\nWhistleblowing Policy, Schneider Electric employees have a\\nresponsibility to report potential unethical behaviors. To voluntarily\\nreport a potential violation of laws and regulations, and/or of the\\nGroup’s Trust Charter and Group policies, whistleblowers can use\\nall reporting channels available.\\nAt Schneider Electric, internal stakeholders, may report concerns\\neither by contacting an appropriate person in the Group (manager,\\nHR business partner, Legal Counsel, or Compliance Officer) and/or\\nby using the Trust Line, Schneider Electric’s whistleblowing system.\\nAll the potential channels used should be, at the end, linked back\\nto the Trust Line system as a consolidation tool of this type of\\ninformation. The latter is available online globally, always, and\\nprotects the anonymity of the whistleblower (unless there is\\nlegislation to the contrary). In compliance with local legislation,\\nthis system is provided by an external, impartial third-party\\ncompany and proposes alert categories, a questionnaire, and an\\ninformation exchange protocol between the person issuing the alert\\nand the person responsible for the case management. Overall,\\ncase management is a structured process led by Ethics &\\nCompliance team.', 'S1_G': 'Global Family Leave Policy\\nAs a caring, inclusive, and responsible employer, Schneider\\nlaunched its Global Family Leave policy along with care leave in\\n2017. Through its policy, the Group supports employees with\\npersonal time at critical life stages and empowers everyone to\\nmanage their “unique life and work” to enable them to be at their\\nbest. While countries have flexibility to define eligibility and policy\\ndetails per statutory and/or market requirements, the policy\\nestablishes a global minimum standard for paid leave.\\nIn 2023, the Group globally deployed the updated Global Family\\nLeave Policy for all employees, where parental and care leave were\\nincreased. Although the duration for bereavement leaves remained\\nunchanged, the local adaptation was enhanced by adopting a\\nflexible definition of “Immediate Family” in acknowledgment of the\\ndiverse cultures and religions displayed by the global workforce.\\nSchneider Electric’s Global Family Leave Policy was recognized by\\nthe Brandon Hall Group in September 2023, receiving a Gold\\nAward for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion – affirming the Group’s\\nposition as a caring, inclusive, and responsible employer.\\nAdditional to the Group’s Global Family Leave Policy and, in\\nsupport of global standards and local empowerment, back-up\\nfamily care benefits are offered in some countries to assist\\nemployees with family care needs when they experience disruption\\nin regular care arrangements. In the absence of a Group-level\\nback-up family care policy, the Group highlights examples of\\nback-up family care benefits that are offered at the country level.\\nGlobally, the Group also offers an Employee Assistance Program\\nwith coverage in over 90% of its operating countries which\\nprovides additional support and resources for mental well-being\\nand family care.\\nBeyond the Global Family Leave Policy and Employee Assistance\\nProgram, some countries where Schneider Electric operates\\nprovide support in the form of on-site childcare facilities, childcare\\ncontributions, and breast-feeding and lactation benefits.\\nThe policy is accessible to employees via the intranet and has been\\napproved by the Chief Human Resource Officer, reviewed by the\\nSenior Vice-President Total Rewards & Performance, with policy\\nownership by the Vice-President, Total Rewards & Performance\\nInnovation & Strategy.\\n\\n---\\n\\nGlobal benefit standards\\nSchneider Electric regularly reviews compliance with its global\\nbenefit policies and principles to ensure that its inclusive global\\nbenefit standards are delivered for all employees. These policies\\nand standards cover access to healthcare, retirement, and savings,\\npaid and unpaid leaves, and insurance on accident and life.\\nOne of Schneider Electric’s underlying benefit objectives is to\\nensure all its employees are equipped to manage their basic health\\nand well-being and to provide adequate security to both\\nemployees and their dependents. Health and well-being are\\nembedded in the Schneider Electric people priorities and\\ncontribute to its sustainability mission. The Group is committed to\\nprovide employees access to a well-being at work program –\\ntranslated into a dual standard of access to healthcare and\\nwell-being training programs. It also provides access to an\\ninclusive and comprehensive standard of healthcare coverage\\n(outpatient, hospitalization, key health risks/chronic conditions,\\nmaternity, children) defined by local regulations and employment\\nagreements\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn addition, sustainability statements (CSRD) requirements cover a)\\nPercentage of people in its own workforce who are covered by\\nhealth and safety management system based on legal\\nrequirements and (or) recognized standards or guidelines, b) Rate\\nof recordable work-related accidents for own workforce, c) Number\\nof fatalities in own workforce as result of work-related injuries and\\nwork-related ill health, d) Number of fatalities as result of work-\\nrelated injuries and work-related ill health of other workers working\\non undertaking’s sites.\\nCompared to the SSE, sustainability statements (CSRD) are\\nincluding more sites and include only Schneider Electric\\nemployees, as defined by the text.\\n43% of employees are working in Schneider Electric sites with ISO\\n45001 certification and are covered by a health and safety\\nmanagement system. The rate of recordable work-related\\naccidents for own workforce was 0.54, connected with 168\\nwork-related accidents. There were no work-related injuries and\\nwork-related ill health fatalities in Schneider Electric’s own\\nworkforce in 2024. One Schneider Electric contractor fatality\\noccurred in India while a contractor was installing solar panels and\\nfell through a roof skylight.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSocial protection Industrial wages are often not sufficient to provide adequate living standards. The problem is exacerbated\\nin cases of health emergencies. Social protection, provided by employers/governments, provide a much-\\nneeded safety net from economic shock, descent into poverty, and vulnerability. Companies should ensure\\nthat all employees have access to the social security safety net.\\n\\n---\\n\\nKey Pillars Schneider DW ILO UNGC EU Com SDGs SA8000\\nSocial protection Yes Yes Yes\\n\\n---\\n\\nTaking inspiration from the pioneering work of the International\\nLabour Organization (ILO), Schneider has defined 10 pillars of\\nDecent Work:\\n1. Employment opportunities;\\n2. Adequate earnings and productive work;\\n3. Decent working hours;\\n4. Stability and security of work;\\n5. Social dialogue and workplace relations;\\n6. Fair treatment in employment;\\n7. Safe work;\\n8. Social protection;\\n9. Purchasing practices; and\\n10. Balancing work and family life.\\n\\n---\\n\\nPension benefits\\nSchneider Electric’s policy concerning pension benefits states that:\\n• The Group’s Senior Management who are not subject to the French Social Security System are covered by pension plan arrangements in\\nline with local practices in their respective countries; and\\n• The Group’s Senior Management subject to the French Social Security system, with the exception of the Corporate Officer, are covered\\nby the additional defined-contribution pension (Article 83) plans for employees, and/or Group Senior Management. Their defined-benefit\\npension plan (Article 39) was canceled on March 22, 2016.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNote 20: Pensions and other post-employment benefit\\nobligations\\nThe Group has set up various post-employment benefit plans for employees covering pensions, termination benefits, healthcare, life\\ninsurance and other benefits, as well as long-term benefit plans for active employees.\\nThe benefits offered to each employee depends on local laws and regulations and choices made by the subsidiaries'}}\n"
