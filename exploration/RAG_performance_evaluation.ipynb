It states that excluded entities represent less than 1.5% of the Group’s employees and 0.6% of the Group’s assets, which it deems as a minor exclusion that does not materially impact the overall disclosure. The company uses proxies such as the number of employees and gross value of property, plant, and equipment to assess materiality and ensure the final coverage is representative. Additionally, the workforce data provided covers approximately 88% of employees excluding supplementary employees, indicating a substantial inclusion of materially impacted individuals. However, while the company provides quantifiable data on workforce coverage and exclusions, the assurance is limited and the exclusions, though small, could still omit some materially impacted individuals. The information reflects the company's view and is grounded in concrete data, but a critical perspective would note that the exclusions and limited assurance may leave some gaps in full material coverage disclosure.\", 'sources': [126, 351]}, 'S1_A2': {'verdict': 'YES', 'analysis': \"[[YES]] The company does describe the types of employees in its own workforce that are subject to material impacts. The report explicitly mentions a diverse workforce encompassing various employment contracts tailored to the organization's global operations, indicating recognition of different employee types (Source 205). It also highlights material impacts on its own workforce, including poor working conditions such as excessive working hours and poor work-life balance (Source 206). Furthermore, the company acknowledges risks related to its workforce, such as strikes and loss of talent, which implies attention to operational risks affecting employee groups (Source 206). The disclosure also extends to workers in the value chain, including suppliers’ employees and contractors, addressing working conditions, health and safety, and forced labor (Source 205). However, while these descriptions indicate awareness of different employee categories and related impacts, the report largely reflects the company’s perspective and relies on qualitative descriptions rather than detailed, quantifiable data. Some statements may verge on cheap talk, as they lack concrete metrics or specific breakdowns of employee types by impact severity. Overall, the company provides a reasonable but somewhat general description of employee types subject to material impacts, consistent with European sustainability reporting standards but with room for more granular disclosure.\", 'sources': [205, 206]}, 'S1_A3': {'verdict': 'YES', 'analysis': '[[YES]] The company explicitly describes types of non-employees in its own workforce who are subject to material impacts. It identifies non-employees as including both individual contractors supplying labor (\"self-employed people\") and persons provided by Schneider Electric who are primarily engaged in \"employment activities.\" This categorization indicates an awareness of the material impacts on these groups within its workforce. However, while these categories are mentioned, the disclosures lack detailed quantifiable data or specific metrics on how these non-employees are impacted or managed, which raises questions about the depth and transparency of the reporting.

It also emphasizes continuous investment in training and skills development to improve employability, linking these activities to enhanced morale and workforce resilience. Quantitative data such as 74% of employees feeling the organization looks after their well-being and 81% having flexible work arrangements provide some measurable insight into the impact of these policies. However, the disclosures tend to be broad and somewhat generic, with limited detailed metrics or concrete outcomes beyond employee survey results.

This indicates a process to evaluate whether employees know about and trust these grievance mechanisms. However, the disclosure lacks detail on the methodology or frequency of this assessment, and no quantifiable data or concrete metrics are provided to verify the effectiveness or depth of this evaluation. While the company claims to assess awareness, the absence of detailed evidence or results suggests a risk of greenwashing or at least a superficial treatment of this important aspect. The information represents the company's view based on its report, and the lack of transparency on how the assessment is conducted limits the ability to fully verify the robustness of this disclosure.\", 'sources': [183, 182]}, 'S1_F9': {'verdict': 'NO', 'analysis': '[[NO]] The company discloses that it has established multiple channels for its own workforce to raise concerns, including an integrity portal, hotline, and email, which are accessible worldwide and in multiple languages.

There is no indication of any process or metric used to evaluate whether the workforce trusts that these channels are effective or safe to use. The disclosure focuses on the existence and accessibility of the channels rather than on any assessment of their perceived reliability or trustworthiness by employees. This lack of evaluation represents a significant gap in the company’s social sustainability reporting, as trust in grievance mechanisms is critical for their effectiveness. The information provided appears to be the company’s view and is based on qualitative descriptions without quantifiable data or evidence of employee feedback or trust assessments, which raises concerns about potential greenwashing or superficial reporting on this important aspect.', 'sources': [183, 196]}, 'S1_F10': {'verdict': 'YES', 'analysis': \"[[YES]] The company discloses that it has policies in place to protect individuals against retaliation for raising concerns. Specifically, Continental's Code of Conduct and internal whistleblowing rules explicitly define non-tolerance of retaliation against whistleblowers, listing serious offenses such as dismissal, blacklisting, demotion, denial of benefits, and intimidation, which are penalized. The company also emphasizes confidentiality, anonymity, and non-retaliation as key principles, although it acknowledges limitations under the German Whistleblower Protection Act that may affect full assurance of these protections. Multiple reporting channels are available, including an integrity portal, hotline, and email, with regular communication and mandatory training to employees on whistleblowing. However, the disclosures largely reflect the company's stated policies and procedures without providing quantifiable data or independent verification of effectiveness, which raises the possibility of greenwashing. The report relies on broad statements about the existence of protections and processes but lacks concrete evidence or metrics demonstrating the actual enforcement or outcomes of these policies. Therefore, while the company presents a comprehensive framework for protecting whistleblowers, the information should be viewed critically as it is primarily the company's own representation without robust supporting data.\", 'sources': [210, 183, 206, 211]}, 'S1_F11': {'verdict': 'YES', 'analysis': '[[YES]] The company does describe actions taken to provide or enable remedy for actual material impacts on its own workforce.

It also details taking action on material impacts and approaches to mitigating material risks related to its own workforce (Source 180, 216). However, the disclosures appear to be largely descriptive and lack quantifiable data or concrete examples of remediation outcomes, which raises concerns about potential greenwashing or vague commitments. The company’s statements reflect its own view and are framed within management approaches and strategic decisions based on identified impacts (Sources 175, 180, 216). While the presence of remediation processes and channels is positive, the absence of detailed evidence or measurable results limits the ability to fully verify the effectiveness of these actions.

While the report provides data on sickness, including paid and unpaid sick days, and mentions that this data is collected by individual locations and calculated as a ratio of sick days to total working hours, it does not clarify if all employees have social protection coverage for sickness. The sickness metric is entity-specific and excludes interns, apprentices, and non-employees, but there is no direct statement confirming universal social protection coverage. Additionally, the report mentions occupational safety and health management system certification covering 67% of employees, which suggests incomplete coverage in this area as well. The collective bargaining and social dialogue coverage rates are also presented in ranges without clear indication of full social protection coverage. Overall, the disclosures rely on quantitative data about sickness absence and some health and safety certifications but lack a clear, comprehensive statement on social protection coverage for sickness, which raises concerns about transparency and completeness. This absence of explicit disclosure could be seen as a gap or potential greenwashing, as the company may be emphasizing certain health metrics without confirming full social protection coverage.

The information is fragmented and primarily addresses other aspects of social sustainability like workplace representation in certain countries, pension strategies, and sick leave metrics. The absence of clear, quantifiable data or statements on unemployment protection coverage suggests a gap in disclosure. This lack of transparency could be seen as a potential omission or an area where the company might be avoiding detailed reporting, which raises questions about the comprehensiveness of their social protection disclosures.

There is no specific disclosure on whether this benefit applies universally to all employees or only certain groups. The report also lacks concrete data on social protection coverage for parental leave, which raises concerns about the completeness and transparency of the disclosure. Given the absence of detailed, entity-wide coverage information, the statement appears to be more of a general claim rather than a fully substantiated fact, which could be interpreted as a form of cheap talk.

The pension obligations are concentrated in a few countries (Germany, USA, UK, Canada), which account for over 90% of obligations, suggesting potential gaps in other regions. Additionally, the report references collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue metrics but only for certain EEA countries with significant employee numbers, without confirming full social protection coverage.

Additionally, the report acknowledges challenges related to job security in transitioning markets but stops short of specifying where social protection is lacking.

This is evident from the report where it states that \"The development of measures and strategic decisions based on the identified impacts are described as part of the management approach\" (Source 193). Additionally, the report mentions that \"The material impacts on own workforce are not directly related to changes resulting from sustainability, e.g. the transition towards zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles\" (Source 175), implying that the company is taking steps to mitigate these impacts. Furthermore, the report highlights that \"The corresponding results be found under: › Details of the material impacts, risks and opportunities › as well as in the described impacts in the topic-related sections\" (Source 118), suggesting that the company is actively working on addressing these risks. However, it is essential to note that these statements might be cheap talks, and the company's actual actions and effectiveness in mitigating these risks are unclear without further information.\n",

However, none of these sources explicitly mention social protection for parental leave. The company also mentions that employees are not included in the calculation of gender distribution (Sources: 186, 188, 190), but this does not provide information on parental leave benefits. Therefore, the answer is [[NO]].\n",

The report mentions characteristics of the company's employees (Sources 183-184), but it does not provide information on parental leave benefits. The report also mentions adequate wages (Source 186), but it does not address parental leave protection. Finally, the report mentions that the company only contributes contractually fixed amounts for current service entitlements, which are generally invested by independent, external asset managers until the date of retirement of the employee (Source 259), but it does not provide information on parental leave benefits.\n",

However, the report does not provide clear information on how these processes are used to identify what action is needed in response to actual or potential negative impacts on its own workforce.

According to the report, Continental AG pursues management approaches to address material impacts on its own workforce (Source 173). The company mentions that these measures also support the prevention of discrimination and achieving equal treatment of employees (Source 184). Additionally, the report states that the effectiveness of the management approach is monitored via dedicated feedback channels, HR processes, and reported metrics (Source 180). However, the report lacks concrete data and quantifiable metrics to support these claims. For instance, the report mentions that the OpEx for key actions to achieve the target related to own workforce is €13 million in 2024 (Source 2024), but this figure is not contextualized within the broader sustainability strategy. Furthermore, the report does not provide a clear explanation of how these actions will lead to material opportunities related to its own workforce.\n",

Against the backdrop of  \\na weak macroeconomic environment – especially in our core market of Europe – and a global downturn in auto-\\nmotive production, our value-creation strategy is proving effective. \\nOur results in 2024 show that we achieved our annual targets for the Continental Group: \\n› We increased our adjusted EBIT margin from 6.1 percent in the previous year to 6.8 percent – a further step  \\ntoward boosting our profitability. \\n› In the Automotive group sector, we continued to improve despite a challenging market environment, increasing \\nthe adjusted EBIT margin to 2.3 percent. This shows that the measures we have taken are having an impact and \\nthat Automotive – under the management of Philipp von Hirschheydt – is on the right track. \\n› The Tires group sector continues to perform strongly. With sales of €13.9 billion, Tires slightly increased its  \\nadjusted EBIT margin year-on-year to 13.7 percent. Tires holds a leading market position in high-performance \\nand sustainable premium tires. \\n› Faced with a weak automotive and industrial environment, the ContiTech group sector saw a decline in earnings \\nbut nonetheless achieved its annual target, with an adjusted EBIT margin of 6.2 percent, thanks to a good fourth \\nquarter. Continental also introduced further measures to strengthen ContiTech. \\n› At €1.05 billion our adjusted free cash flow is slightly higher than expected. This was mainly due to a positive \\ncash contribution from the Automotive group sector, the good tire business and the reduction in inventories.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nChairman’s Letter \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Chairman’s Letter \\n5\\n \\nAchieving all this despite significant external challenges is a testament to our more than 190,000 employees \\naround the world. They have worked tirelessly during this period of transformation to achieve the company’s \\ngoals. Their commitment deserves the utmost recognition, gratitude and respect from the entire Executive Board. \\nTogether, we have embarked on the implementation phase of our strategic plan. The goal is to tap into our full \\npotential for creating value – in the interests of all our stakeholders. \\n \\nOver the course of 2024, we further strengthened the independence of our group sectors. Building on a series of \\nacquisitions since the mid-2000s, we have now shaped these technologically and culturally diverse business oper-\\nations into competitive units. They have matured into independent players that going forward will need to act with \\ngreater flexibility and make the most of the extensive entrepreneurial freedom available to them. \\n \\nWith this in mind, we made the following strategic decisions last year: \\n › Subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board and the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of Continental AG, we plan \\nto complete the spin-off of Automotive and Contract Manufacturing. Automotive is to be set up as an independent \\nEuropean company (Societas Europaea, SE) and listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange by the end of 2025.  \\n› To strengthen the independence of Tires and ContiTech, Continental is further expanding the necessary busi-\\nness-related structures in both group sectors. At the same time, the group functions at the holding level are  \\nbeing streamlined, primarily in accordance with the legally required framework conditions. \\n› The Original Equipment Solutions (OESL) business area within the ContiTech group sector will also become  \\nindependent prior to its planned sale. \\nThese strategic measures will make our group sectors stronger – and create more value for you. \\n \\nContinental achieved good results in 2024. And we want you, as our shareholders, to share in this accomplishment. \\nThe Executive Board and Supervisory Board will therefore propose a dividend of €2.50 per share to the Annual \\nShareholders’ Meeting. By doing so, we want to underline our ambition as a worthwhile investment for investors \\nwith a focus on sustainability – and express our thanks for your trust in us as a company. \\nDespite the difficult market environment, we aim to continue our upward trajectory in 2025. We have set the right \\ncourse and have our strategy to guide us, as we position ourselves to create the greatest possible value in the  \\ninterests of all stakeholders.  \\n \\n \\nNikolai Setzer \\nChairman of the Executive Board\\n', 'Christian Kötz\\nBorn in 1970 in Braunschweig, Germany\\nTires Group Sector\\nAppointed until April 2027\\nDr. Ariane Reinhart\\nBorn in 1969 in Hamburg, Germany\\nGroup Human Relations\\nDirector of Labor Relations\\nGroup Sustainability\\nAppointed until September 2025\\nMembers of the Executive Board\\nNikolai Setzer\\nBorn in 1971 in Groß-Gerau, Germany\\nChairman of the Executive Board\\nGroup Communications and Public Affairs\\nGroup Strategy\\nGroup Purchasing\\nGroup Information Technology\\nContract Manufacturing Group Sector\\nChinese Market\\nAppointed until March 2029\\nPhilipp von Hirschheydt\\nBorn in 1974 in Münden, Germany\\nAutomotive Group Sector\\nAppointed until April 2026\\nPhilip Nelles\\nBorn in 1974 in Berlin, Germany\\nContiTech Group Sector\\nAppointed until May 2029\\nOlaf Schick\\nBorn in 1972 in Tübingen, Germany\\nGroup Finance and Controlling\\nGroup Compliance\\nGroup Internal Audit\\nGroup Law and Intellectual Property\\nGroup Quality, Technical Compliance, \\nContinental Business System and Environment\\nGroup Risks and Controls\\nTerm of office runs until September 2025\\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Continental Shares and Bonds \\n7\\n \\n \\nData source: Bloomberg. \\nPositive trend on the stock markets \\nIn 2024, the stock markets were influenced by a fall in inflation, the \\nmonetary policy decisions taken by central banks and corporate \\nearnings in the artificial intelligence technology sector. Following \\nan uncertain start to the year, the markets stabilized and then im-\\nproved. This was driven by falling energy prices, stabilized supply \\nchains and improved global growth indicators. Robust corporate \\nearnings and a drop in base rates supported this development in \\nmany major economies. Although central banks lowered interest \\nrates more slowly than expected and key economies such as China \\nand Europe continued to trend downward, this had only a limited \\nimpact on the performance of the stock markets. In fact, falling in-\\nflation rates and an easing of monetary policy led to price increases \\nin the first half of the year. \\nInflation continued to ease as the year progressed, both in the USA \\nand in the eurozone. In response to this, central banks such as the \\nFederal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered their \\nbase rates, triggering a positive reaction on the stock markets. The \\nEuropean export industry benefited from a weaker euro against the \\nUS dollar, which in turn positively impacted share prices. \\nThe DAX, which reached a new all-time high of 20,426.27 points in \\nDecember 2024, closed the year at 19,909.14 points. This repre-\\nsented an increase of 18.8% compared with the end of 2023, when \\nit was quoted at 16,751.64 points. The EURO STOXX 50 rose by \\n8.3% in 2024 and ended the year at 4,895.98 points. \\nShare price declines for traditional automotive stocks \\nThe performance of automotive stocks was mixed in the first half \\nof 2024. While certain companies benefited from an increase in \\ndemand and saw their share prices rise, other manufacturers were \\nfaced with production issues and weak sales markets. The perfor-\\nmance of automotive stocks deteriorated over the course of the \\nsecond quarter due to the political discussions concerning punitive \\ntariffs between China and Europe. European and American auto-\\nmotive manufacturers suffered price losses from the middle of the \\nyear due to the decline in demand and associated weak results.  \\nIn addition to macroeconomic uncertainties, the transformation  \\nto electric mobility and challenges in Asia also led to share price \\ndeclines. By contrast, new automotive manufacturers, particularly \\nfrom China, gained market share and saw share prices rise. \\nWeak demand and the transformation meant that the majority  \\nof the automotive industry was forced to revise its 2024 targets \\ndownward, causing the share prices of many listed companies to \\nfall. The STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts recorded a 12.2% \\nloss in 2024 compared with the end of 2023, taking it to 551.47 \\npoints. \\nContinental shares suffer losses \\nContinental’s share price performance was negative in the first \\nquarter of 2024. After a fairly stable start to the year, the share \\nprice fell sharply toward the end of the first quarter. The share \\nprice continued to decline in the second quarter as a result of sub-\\ndued expectations in the automotive industry and inflation effects, \\nfalling from €66.90 at the end of the first quarter to €52.90 at the \\nend of the first half of the year. On April 29, 2024, the share price \\nwas marked down to reflect the dividend of €2.20 for fiscal 2023 \\nresolved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. Continental’s share \\nprice was volatile in the third quarter, with positive and negative \\nmomentum balancing each other out. The quarterly results and \\nthe announcement of the planned spin-off of the Automotive and \\nContract Manufacturing group sectors had a positive impact on \\nthe share price. Possible warranties in the brakes business, how-\\never, had the opposite effect. Continental shares ultimately made \\ngains in the fourth quarter. \\nAt the end of 2024, Continental’s shares were listed at €64.82. \\nThis represented a decrease of 15.7% compared with the year-end \\nprice of €76.92 in 2023. Taking into account a reinvestment of the \\ndividend paid out on the distribution date, the share price fell by \\n12.7% in 2024. \\nContinental\\nDAX\\nSTOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts\\nEURO STOXX 50\\nPrice performance of Continental shares in 2024 versus selected stock indexes\\nIndexed to January 1, 2024\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n120\\n140\\nDecember\\nJanuary\\nFebruary\\nMarch\\nApril\\nMay\\nJune\\nJuly\\nAugust\\nSeptember\\nOctober\\nNovember\\nContinental Shares and Bonds \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Continental Shares and Bonds \\n8\\n \\n \\nContinental bonds outstanding as at December 31, 2024 \\nWKN/ISIN \\nCoupon p.a. \\nMaturity \\nVolume in \\n€ millions \\nIssue price \\nPrice as at \\nDec. 31, 2024 \\nPrice as at \\nDec. 31, 2023 \\nA2YPAE/XS2056430874 \\n0.375% \\nJune 27, 2025 \\n600 \\n99.802% \\n98.782% \\n96.117% \\nA28XTR/XS2178586157 \\n2.500% \\nAugust 27, 2026 \\n750 \\n98.791% \\n99.614% \\n98.922% \\nA35138/XS2672452237 \\n4.000% \\nMarch 1, 2027 \\n500 \\n99.658% \\n102.247% \\n102.347% \\nA30VQ4/XS2558972415 \\n3.625% \\nNovember 30, 2027 \\n625 \\n100.000% \\n101.760% \\n101.708% \\nA351PU/XS2630117328 \\n4.000% \\nJune 1, 2028 \\n750 \\n99.445% \\n103.362% \\n103.346% \\nA383VK/XS2910509566 \\n3.500% \\nOctober 1, 2029 \\n600 \\n99.946% \\n100.995% \\n— \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPerformance of Continental bonds  \\nInterest rates for European corporate bonds with credit ratings  \\nsimilar to bonds of Continental remained stable in the period under \\nreview, despite some fluctuations due to geopolitical uncertainties \\nand economic challenges. The ECB’s interest rate cuts led to a nor-\\nmalization of the yield curve with lower interest rates for shorter \\nmaturities. The prices of Continental bonds maturing by 2026 rose \\nyear-on-year at the end of 2024, while prices of bonds with longer \\nterms remained stable. \\nSuccessful placement of a euro bond \\nUnder the Debt Issuance Programme (DIP), one new Continental AG \\neuro bond was successfully placed with investors in Germany and \\nabroad on September 24, 2024. The euro bond was issued on Oc-\\ntober 1, 2024, with an interest coupon of 3.500% p.a. and a term of \\nfive years. With a nominal volume of €600 million, the issue price \\namounted to 99.946%. The bond was launched on the regulated \\nmarket of the Luxembourg stock exchange on October 1, 2024. \\nRepayment of a euro bond \\nThe price of the 1.125% Continental bond that matured on Sep-\\ntember 25, 2024, started the year at 98.016%. On the due date, \\nthe repayment was made at a nominal value of €625 million.  \\nPositive earnings per share \\nCost-cutting measures, price adjustments and efficiency improve-\\nments led to a positive earnings trend in the reporting year, despite \\nweak production volumes. Consequently, net income attributable to \\nthe shareholders of the parent increased to €1,168 million in fiscal \\n2024 (PY: €1,156 million). Earnings per share amounted to €5.84 \\nin 2024 (PY: €5.78). \\nDividend proposal of €2.50 for fiscal 2024 \\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board have resolved to \\npropose to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, which will be held in \\nHanover on April 25, 2025, that a dividend of €2.50 per share be \\npaid out for the past fiscal year and that the retained earnings for \\nfiscal 2024 be allocated to other revenue reserves. For fiscal 2023, \\na dividend of €2.20 per share was paid out on May 2, 2024.  \\nShare capital unchanged \\nAs at the end of fiscal 2024, the share capital of Continental AG still \\namounted to €512,015,316.48. It is divided into 200,005,983 no-\\npar-value shares with a notional value of €2.56 per share.  \\nIn line with Article 20 of Continental AG’s Articles of Incorpora-\\ntion, each share grants one vote at the Shareholders’ Meeting. \\nThe current Articles of Incorporation are available on our website  \\n www.continental.com under Company/Corporate Governance.  \\nAll shares have the same dividend and voting rights. \\nFree float stable at 54.0% \\nAs in the previous year, free float as defined by Deutsche Börse AG \\namounted to 54.0% as at the end of 2024. The most recent \\nchange took place on September 17, 2013, when our major share-\\nholder, the IHO Group, Herzogenaurach, Germany, announced the \\nsale of 7.8 million Continental shares, reducing its shareholding in \\nContinental AG from 49.9% to 46.0%. \\nAs at the end of 2024, the market capitalization of Continental AG \\namounted to €13.0 billion (PY: €15.4 billion). Market capitalization \\non the basis of free float averaged €7.0 billion over the last 20 trad-\\ning days of the reporting year (PY: €8.0 billion). Free-float market \\ncapitalization is the decisive factor for index calculation in the regu-\\nlatory framework of Deutsche Börse AG. At the end of 2024, Conti-\\nnental AG ranked 39th in terms of free-float market capitalization \\non the DAX (PY: 37th). \\nFree-float distribution largely stable in 2024 \\nAs at the end of the year, we once again determined the distribution \\nof free float of Continental shares by way of shareholder identifica-\\ntion. We were able to assign 106 million of the 108 million shares \\nheld in the form of shares or alternatively as American depositary \\nreceipts (ADRs) in the USA to 841 institutional investors, banks and \\nasset managers across 50 countries. The identification ratio was \\n97.9% (PY: 99.9%). \\nThe identified level of Continental shares held in Europe was lower \\nthan in the previous year at 47.7% of free float (PY: 51.1%). A major \\ncontributor to this year-on-year decline was the identified level  \\nof shares held by investors from the UK and Ireland, at 27.1%  \\n(PY: 31.5%). \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Continental Shares and Bonds \\n9\\n \\nContinental share data \\nType of share \\nNo-par-value share \\nGerman stock exchanges  \\n(regulated market) \\nFrankfurt (Prime Standard),  \\nHamburg, Hanover, Stuttgart \\nGerman securities code number (WKN) \\n543900 \\nISIN \\nDE0005439004 \\nReuters ticker symbol \\nCONG \\nBloomberg ticker symbol \\nCON \\nIndex memberships \\n(selection) \\nDAX, Prime All Share,  \\nPrime Automobile, NISAX \\nOutstanding shares as at December 31, 2024 \\n200,005,983 \\nFree float as at December 31, 2024 \\n54.0% \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental’s American depositary receipt (ADR) data \\nRatio \\n1 share : 10 ADRs \\nSEDOL number \\n2219677 \\nISIN \\nUS2107712000 \\nReuters ticker symbol \\nCTTAY.PK \\nBloomberg ticker symbol \\nCTTAY \\nADR level \\nLevel 1 \\nTrading \\nOTC \\nSponsor \\nDeutsche Bank Trust \\nCompany Americas \\nADRs issued as at December 31, 2024 \\n26,091,400 (with 2,609,140 \\nContinental shares deposited) \\n \\n \\n \\nThe identified free-float holdings of German investors decreased to \\n5.6% in the year under review (PY: 6.9%).  \\nThe free-float holdings of Scandinavian investors rose to 3.7% in \\n2024 (PY: 3.3%).  \\nFrench investors held 4.3% of Continental free-float shares at the \\nend of 2024 (PY: 3.1%). \\nInvestors in other European countries increased their share of free \\nfloat slightly to 6.9% in 2024 (PY: 6.3%).  \\nShareholdings of investors in North America increased year-on-year \\nin 2024.

In addition, the Supervisory Board closely \\nsupervised, carefully monitored and advised the Executive Board  \\nin the management of the company. It was also directly involved in \\na timely manner in all decisions of fundamental importance to the \\ncompany.  \\nThe Executive Board provided the Supervisory Board with regular, \\ntimely and comprehensive updates at its meetings as well as ver-\\nbally and in writing on all issues of relevance to the company. In \\nparticular, these include the business performance, business strat-\\negy, planning, significant business transactions in the company and \\nthe Continental Group, and the related risks and opportunities, as \\nwell as compliance issues. The members of the Supervisory Board \\nwere also available to the Executive Board for consultation outside \\nthe meetings. As chairman of the Supervisory Board, I had regular \\ncontact with the members of the Executive Board, in particular with \\nits chairman, and discussed current company issues and develop-\\nments with them. Pursuant to a suggestion of the German Corpo-\\nrate Governance Code, I also held discussions with investors in fis-\\ncal 2024 on topics specific to the Supervisory Board.  \\nMeetings of the Supervisory Board and the committees \\nThe Supervisory Board convened for five ordinary meetings and \\none extraordinary meeting in fiscal 2024, as well as for the strategy \\nmeeting. The meeting in June and the extraordinary meeting in  \\nAugust took place virtually, while all other meetings were held in \\nperson. At its meetings, the Supervisory Board regularly conferred \\npart of the time in the absence of the Executive Board. In addition \\nto these meetings, the Supervisory Board passed one resolution on \\nthe profile of skills and expertise and on the qualifications matrix by \\nwritten procedure. \\nThe Chairman’s Committee held five meetings in the reporting year \\n(four in person and one virtually) and passed two resolutions by \\nwritten procedure. The Audit Committee met four times in 2024 \\n(all in person). The Mediation Committee in accordance with Sec-\\ntion 27 (3) of the German Co-determination Act (Mitbestimmungs-\\ngesetz – MitbestG) was not required to meet in 2024, and neither \\nwas the Committee for Related Party Transactions (RPT Committee) \\nnor the Nomination Committee. \\nThe special committee formed in connection with the Supervisory \\nBoard’s investigation into the manipulation of emission limits by \\ncertain automotive manufacturers (Special Emissions Committee) \\nwas no longer required in the year under review and was dissolved \\nfollowing the conclusion of these investigations by resolution of the \\nSupervisory Board at its meeting on April 26, 2024. \\nThere are no other committees. All committees report to the plenary \\nsession. The corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections \\n289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetz-\\nbuch – HGB) starting on page 16 describes their responsibilities in \\nmore detail and names their members. \\nThe following overview provides information on the individual at-\\ntendance of the Supervisory Board members at meetings of the \\nSupervisory Board and its committees. \\nIndividual attendance of Supervisory Board members at in-\\nperson and virtual meetings of the Supervisory Board and its \\ncommittees in fiscal 2024 \\nAttendance \\nNumber of \\nmeetings \\nPercentage \\nSupervisory Board plenary session \\nProf. Dr.-Ing.

Where the actual course of business deviated from the de-\\nfined plans and targets, the Executive Board provided detailed ex-\\nplanations. It discussed the reasons for these deviations and the \\nmeasures introduced in depth with the Supervisory Board. In addi-\\ntion, the Executive Board regularly informed the Supervisory Board \\nabout the Continental Group’s main procurement and sales mar-\\nkets and about Continental AG’s share price performance.  \\nIn addition, the work of the Supervisory Board and its collaboration \\nwith the Executive Board in the year under review continued to be \\nshaped by the transformation process in the automotive industry, the \\nweak macroeconomic environment and the resulting consequences \\nfor the company. Another focus area for the Supervisory Board was \\nmonitoring preparations for the reorganization of the Continental \\nGroup, with largely independent group sectors and the planned spin-\\noff of the Automotive and Contract Manufacturing group sectors. At \\nthe start of the year, the Supervisory Board concluded its investiga-\\ntion into the manipulation of emission limits in vehicles of specific  \\nautomotive manufacturers. The Supervisory Board will continue to \\npursue possible claims against former Executive Board members  \\nand managers. The Supervisory Board also regularly addressed the \\nmeasures being taken to strengthen the risk management and inter-\\nnal control system as well as the compliance management system.  \\nAt the meeting on March 12, 2024, the company’s annual financial \\nstatements and the consolidated financial statements for 2023 were \\ndiscussed and subsequently approved in the presence of the auditor. \\nAs part of reporting for the current fiscal year, the Supervisory Board \\nclosely examined the business development and market situation, \\nparticularly for the Automotive group sector.  \\nThe decision by the Executive Board to hold the Annual Sharehold-\\ners’ Meeting in person in 2024, for the first time since the corona-\\nvirus pandemic ended, was also approved, as was the draft agenda \\nfor the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. In addition, the Supervisory \\nBoard also adopted its proposed resolutions for the Annual Share-\\nholders’ Meeting. These included proposals for the new election of \\nshareholder representatives by implementation of the staggered \\nboard concept (see the section on personnel changes on the Su-\\npervisory Board and Executive Board), and the adjusted remunera-\\ntion system for the Executive Board as part of the regular submis-\\nsion for approval. The Supervisory Board also addressed the status \\nof the measures being taken to strengthen governance and compli-\\nance. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board received reports from in-\\nternal and external experts on the key findings of the internal inves-\\ntigation into the supply of engine control units and engine control \\nsoftware by Continental in connection with the manipulation of \\nemission limits by certain automotive manufacturers. \\nAt the Supervisory Board meeting on April 26, 2024, in view of the \\nfall in Continental AG’s share price, the Supervisory Board discussed \\nthe reasons behind the weak business performance in the first quar-\\nter. Furthermore, the agreement reached with the public prosecu-\\ntor’s office in Hanover on the fine proceedings in connection with \\nthe supply of engine control units and engine control software was \\ndiscussed, and the Special Emissions Committee was dissolved \\nupon completion of the internal investigation. The Supervisory \\nBoard also acknowledged the work carried out by the employee \\nrepresentatives leaving the committee at the end of the Annual \\nShareholders’ Meeting on the same day and bade them farewell.  \\nAt the meeting on June 27, 2024, the Supervisory Board passed a \\nresolution on the succession plan for the position of chief financial \\nofficer and the associated establishment of a newly configured Ex-\\necutive Board function for Group Finance, Integrity and Law, to be \\nheaded by Olaf Schick. Business development was also discussed in \\ndetail, paying particular attention to the macroeconomic situation, \\nincluding the threat of tariffs on automobiles from China. A particu-\\nlar focus was placed on the situation in the Automotive group sector \\nand the measures taken there to cut costs and improve earnings. \\nThe projects and measures planned for the rest of the year and be-\\nyond to strengthen the risk and compliance management system \\nwere also presented.  \\nAt the extraordinary meeting on August 5, 2024, the Executive \\nBoard presented to the Supervisory Board the results of an analysis \\nit had carried out regarding a possible spin-off of the Automotive \\nand Contract Manufacturing group sectors with subsequent listing. \\nIn addition to the benefits of an independent, agile Automotive or-\\nganization, the financial feasibility was also explained. Following \\nthis, the Supervisory Board discussed in detail the impact of such  \\na transaction, both on the group sectors and on employees, and \\ngave the Executive Board suggestions for the further detailed eval-\\nuation of the possible spin-off.  \\nThe Supervisory Board took the opportunity provided by the full-\\nday strategy meeting on September 18, 2024, to visit the Conti-\\nnental Automotive Romania location in Timisoara, Romania. There, \\nthe Executive Board and Supervisory Board discussed the strategic \\ngoals and strategic planning for the Continental Group and the indi-\\nvidual group sectors in detail. These discussions also addressed the \\nfuture setup of an independent Automotive organization and the \\nrequirements necessary for a successful stock market listing. The \\nExecutive Board additionally presented the plans to the Supervisory \\nBoard for the remaining group sectors, according to which Tires \\nand ContiTech would also become largely independent under a \\nlean holding structure. As part of the ContiTech strategy, topics dis-\\ncussed included the status of the realignment resulting from the \\nplanned sale of the Original Equipment Solutions (OESL) business \\narea. Discussions also covered experiences with personnel programs \\naimed at dealing with the effects of the transformation of the auto-\\nmotive industry, possible growth areas for individual group sectors \\nand their sustainability strategy.  \\nAt the meeting on September 19, 2024, the Supervisory Board \\naddressed the assertion of possible claims for damages against for-\\nmer Executive Board members in connection with Continental’s \\nrole in the manipulation of emission limits in vehicles produced by \\nspecific automotive manufacturers, based on the presentation of \\nfindings of an external analysis. In addition, the Supervisory Board’s \\nSustainability Working Group reported on its activities to support \\nthe group sectors’ sustainability targets. The Executive Board also \\npresented the status of measures to bolster IT security. In the \\ncourse of the presentation on ongoing business development, the \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n12\\n \\nExecutive Board reported in detail on the reasons behind the qual-\\nity situation for the MK C2 integrated brake system, as well as the \\ncurrent status in this regard and the measures introduced. \\nAt the meeting on December 18, 2024, Olaf Schick’s resignation \\neffective September 30, 2025, was approved without the Executive \\nBoard present. Olaf Schick had made this request to the Supervisory \\nBoard due to his appointment to the Board of Management of Mer-\\ncedes-Benz Group AG. In addition, the Supervisory Board determined \\nthe targets for the short-term incentive (STI) and the long-term in-\\ncentive (LTI). The Supervisory Board also discussed the status of \\ndeliberations on the future composition of the Executive Board of \\nContinental AG. In the presence of the Executive Board, the Super-\\nvisory Board extensively addressed the annual planning for 2025 \\nand the long-term planning. It also approved the planning and in-\\nvestment plans for fiscal 2025. This gave the Supervisory Board \\nthe opportunity to discuss possible growth areas that had been in-\\ncluded in planning for the individual group sectors with the Execu-\\ntive Board. Additionally, the Executive Board reported in detail on \\nthe status of preparations for the planned spin-off of the Automo-\\ntive and Contract Manufacturing group sectors and Continental’s \\norganizational realignment. In particular, the Executive Board pre-\\nsented the process for allocating the group functions’ approximately \\n2,600 employees to the group sectors. The Supervisory Board also \\napproved several internal capital increases in preparation for the  \\norganizational changes.  \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n 13\\n \\nThe Chairman’s Committee held five meetings in the year under \\nreview, in which it primarily prepared the personnel-related deci-\\nsions of the plenary session and made recommendations for reso-\\nlutions. At its first meeting on March 12, 2024, proposals to the \\nplenary session relating to the setting of targets to be achieved \\nwithin the scope of the short-term incentive (STI) for fiscal 2023 \\nand the 2020–2023 long-term incentive (LTI) tranche were re-\\nsolved. At the meeting on April 26, 2024, the Chairman’s Commit-\\ntee discussed matters such as possible organizational changes to \\nthe work of the Supervisory Board, such as through the introduc-\\ntion of further committees, which was ultimately decided against. \\nAt its meeting on June 27, 2024, it decided to recommend to the \\nplenary session that an Executive Board function for Group Finance, \\nIntegrity and Law be established, combining the responsibilities of \\nthe former Group Finance and Controlling function and Integrity \\nand Law function. This recommendation also included transferring \\nresponsibility for Group Information Technology (IT), which was \\npreviously part of the Finance function, to the chief executive of-\\nficer. It also decided to recommend to the plenary session that Olaf \\nSchick, as the new chief financial officer, should take over the newly \\ncreated function effective July 1, 2024. At the meeting on Septem-\\nber 19, 2024, the Executive Board informed the Chairman’s Com-\\nmittee about the planned sale of Zonar Systems, Inc., Seattle, Wash-\\nington, USA, and explained the reasons for initiating this sales pro-\\ncess. The Chairman’s Committee also discussed the possible impact \\nof the planned spin-off of Automotive and Contract Manufacturing \\non the composition of the Executive Board. In November 2024, the \\nChairman’s Committee approved the sale of Zonar Systems to GPS \\nTrackit by means of two written resolutions adopted by circular res-\\nolution. At its meeting on December 18, 2024, recommendations \\nto the plenary session relating to the targets for the variable remu-\\nneration of the Executive Board were resolved. It was also decided \\nto recommend to the plenary session that it formally approve Olaf \\nSchick’s resignation effective September 30, 2025.  \\nKey topics dealt with by the Audit Committee \\nThe Audit Committee was also informed by the Executive Board  \\nin detail and on an ongoing basis about sales, results and employ-\\nment development in the Continental Group and individual group \\nsectors as well as the financial situation of the company. The Execu-\\ntive Board is assisted by the head of Accounting and the head of \\nGroup Controlling, who attend the meetings of the Audit Commit-\\ntee and can thereby provide information directly. In addition, the \\nchairman of the Audit Committee is in regular contact with the  \\nExecutive Board member for Group Finance, Integrity and Law and \\nwith the auditor outside of meetings and has access to senior em-\\nployees entrusted with tasks relating to accounting, the internal \\ncontrol system, the risk management system, internal auditing and \\ncompliance. The chairman of the Audit Committee shares key infor-\\nmation with the Audit Committee.  \\nAs a focus of each of its quarterly meetings, the Audit Committee \\ntalked with the Executive Board about the accounting as at the end \\nof the previous quarter and the outlook for the year as a whole as \\nwell as the quarterly statements and the half-year financial report \\nprior to their publication. Another focus of the Audit Committee’s \\nwork in the past fiscal year was again on dealing with the risk man-\\nagement and internal control system as well as the compliance \\nmanagement system. The work of the Group Compliance and \\nGroup Internal Audit functions and reporting on significant risks \\nand incidents were also regular topics at each meeting. This in-\\ncluded in particular the matters described in more detail in the  \\nreport on risks and opportunities and in the notes to the consoli-\\ndated financial statements. \\nAt its meeting on March 4, 2024, the Audit Committee discussed \\nthe company’s annual financial statements and the consolidated  \\nfinancial statements as well as the combined non-financial state-\\nment for 2023 with the Executive Board and the auditor, and rec-\\nommended their approval to the plenary session of the Supervisory \\nBoard. The committee also received a report on the status of an ex-\\nternal analysis of Continental’s internal audit system. Another topic \\nof discussion was special effects, which are adjusted for the calcula-\\ntion of earnings for the purposes of determining the variable remu-\\nneration of the Executive Board.  \\nAt the meeting on May 2, 2024, alongside its regular recurring  \\ntopics, the Audit Committee also addressed in detail the progress \\nmade in strengthening the technical compliance management sys-\\ntem. The committee also received reports on the plans to change \\nthe structure of internal auditing activities and on the progress \\nmade in strengthening IT governance.  \\nAt the meeting on August 1, 2024, in addition to the half-year  \\nfinancial statements, one of the main topics on the Audit Commit-\\ntee’s agenda were the ongoing preparations for future sustainability \\nreporting in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2464 on corpo-\\nrate sustainability reporting (Corporate Sustainability Reporting  \\nDirective, CSRD). In addition, the status of several ongoing internal \\ninvestigations was presented to the committee.  \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n14\\n \\nAt the meeting on November 6, 2024, the Audit Committee issued \\nthe mandate for the audit of the 2024 annual and consolidated fi-\\nnancial statements, as well as the report on relations with affiliated \\ncompanies and the remuneration report, and for the audit of sus-\\ntainability reporting, to the auditor appointed by the Annual Share-\\nholders’ Meeting, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschafts-\\nprüfungsgesellschaft, Hanover branch (PwC). In addition, the Audit \\nCommittee defined an approval framework for commissioning the \\nauditor with permissible non-audit services in accordance with the \\nEU Audit Regulation. The Executive Board regularly informs the Au-\\ndit Committee about the use of this authorization. The committee \\nalso once again discussed sustainability reporting for fiscal 2024 \\nand dealt in depth with ongoing preparations for the planned spin-\\noff of the Automotive and Contract Manufacturing group sectors. \\nThe focus here was on special financial reporting requirements re-\\nsulting from the spin-off.  \\n \\nCorporate governance \\nAt its meeting on December 18, 2024, the Supervisory Board \\nadopted its declaration in accordance with Section 161 of the Ger-\\nman Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG) on the recom-\\nmendations of the German Corporate Governance Code. In Febru-\\nary 2024, the Supervisory Board resolved, by written procedure, an \\nextensive revision of the qualifications matrix to be prepared in ac-\\ncordance with the German Corporate Governance Code. The new \\nmatrix contains a more detailed description of the expertise that \\nthe Supervisory Board should possess through its members. The \\ninformation provided by the individual members is based on a self-\\nassessment, which is to be updated regularly. Alongside this new \\nqualifications matrix, the Supervisory Board also resolved to update \\nits profile of skills and expertise and the targets for its composition.  \\nThe chairman of the Supervisory Board was not notified of any po-\\ntential conflicts of interest in 2024. Conflicts of interest notified by \\nthree Supervisory Board members in fiscal 2022 were resolved in \\nthe year under review. Up until said resolution, it continued to be \\nensured that the Supervisory Board members in question did not \\nparticipate in discussions of the Supervisory Board and its commit-\\ntees on topics that could constitute a conflict of interest, and also \\ndid not receive any information in this regard. These still did not \\nconstitute such significant and long-term conflicts of interest that \\nwould have required the members to step down. In its opinion, the \\nSupervisory Board also had an appropriate number of independent \\nmembers, in particular on the shareholder side, as defined in the \\ncode at all times in the period under review. Further information  \\non this topic and on corporate governance in general is included  \\nin the corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f \\nand 315d HGB (starting on page 16).  \\nAnnual and consolidated financial statements and \\nsustainability reporting for 2024 \\nPwC audited the annual financial statements as at December 31, \\n2024, prepared by the Executive Board in accordance with the pro-\\nvisions of the HGB, the 2024 consolidated financial statements and \\nthe combined management report for the company and the Conti-\\nnental Group, including the accounts and the system for early risk \\nrecognition. The 2024 consolidated financial statements of Conti-\\nnental AG were prepared in accordance with the International Finan-\\ncial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The auditor issued unqualified opin-\\nions. In addition, PwC audited the Executive Board’s report on rela-\\ntions with affiliated companies pursuant to Section 312 AktG (de-\\npendent company report). PwC issued the following unqualified \\nopinion on this report in accordance with Section 313 (3) AktG: \\n“Based on the results of our statutory audit and evaluation we con-\\nfirm that: \\n› the actual information included in the report is correct, \\n› with respect to the transactions listed in the report, payments by \\nthe company were not unduly high, and \\n› there are no circumstances in favor of a significantly different as-\\nsessment than that made by the Executive Board in regard to the \\nmeasures listed in the report.” \\nThe Audit Committee discussed the documents relating to the  \\nannual financial statements, including the dependent company re-\\nport, as well as the auditor’s reports and the remuneration report \\nwith the Executive Board and the auditor on March 3, 2025. Fur-\\nthermore, the plenary session of the Supervisory Board discussed \\nthese at length at its meeting to approve the annual financial state-\\nments on March 12, 2025. The discussions also covered the com-\\nbined non-financial statement (in accordance with Sections 315b \\nand 315c in conjunction with Sections 289b to 289e HGB) and the \\nsustainability report (in accordance with the European Sustainabil-\\nity Reporting Standards, ESRS) for the Continental Group and Conti-\\nnental AG (jointly referred to as “sustainability reporting”). The re-\\nquired documents were distributed to all members of the Audit \\nCommittee and the Supervisory Board in good time before these \\nmeetings so that the members had sufficient opportunity to review \\nthem. The auditor was present at these discussions. The auditor re-\\nported on the main results of the audits of financial and sustainabil-\\nity reporting (the latter with limited audit assurance) and was availa-\\nble to provide additional information to the Audit Committee and \\nthe Supervisory Board. Based on its own review of the annual finan-\\ncial statements, the consolidated financial statements, the com-\\nbined management report of Continental AG and of the Continen-\\ntal Group, as well as the dependent company report including the \\nfinal declaration of the Executive Board, and based on the report \\nand the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory \\nBoard concurred with the results of the auditor’s audit. There were \\nno objections. The Supervisory Board approved the annual finan-\\ncial statements and the consolidated financial statements. The  \\nannual financial statements are thereby adopted. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n 15\\n \\nPwC issued an unqualified opinion for the sustainability reporting. \\nBased on the Supervisory Board’s own review, the Audit Commit-\\ntee’s report on its preliminary examination and its recommenda-\\ntion, and PwC’s audit and unqualified opinion on the sustainability \\nreporting, the Supervisory Board finds that the sustainability report-\\ning was prepared in accordance with Sections 315b and 315c in \\nconjunction with Sections 289b to 289e HGB, as well as the provi-\\nsions of the ESRS. The auditor reviewed the remuneration report \\nprepared by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board and  \\nissued a report that is attached to the remuneration report. \\nThe Supervisory Board together with the Executive Board will pro-\\npose to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on April 25, 2025, that  \\na dividend of €2.50 per share entitled to dividends be paid out for \\nthe past fiscal year and that the retained earnings be carried forward \\nto new account. \\nPersonnel changes on the Supervisory Board and Executive \\nBoard \\nAs reported, the term of office for the previous Supervisory Board \\nended with the close of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on April 26, \\n2024. The previous shareholder representatives were all, without \\nexception, re-elected by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. At the \\nsame time, the staggered board concept for shareholder represent-\\natives was introduced with these elections. Under this concept, the \\nterms of office of the shareholder representatives do not run in par-\\nallel; instead, groups of five representatives are elected in staggered \\ncycles for a term of office of four years. To establish this rhythm of \\nstaggered election cycles, five shareholder representatives were \\nelected for a one-time term of office of two years. These were:  \\n \\n› Dr. Gunter Dunkel  \\n› Satish Khatu \\n› Sabine Neuß  \\n› Prof. Dr.-Ing. Wolfgang Reitzle  \\n› Georg F. W. Schaeffler \\n \\nThe following five shareholder representatives were elected for a \\nterm of office of four years:  \\n \\n› Dorothea von Boxberg \\n› Stefan E. Buchner \\n› Isabel Corinna Knauf \\n› Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher  \\n› Klaus Rosenfeld  \\nThe following personnel changes took place among the employee \\nrepresentatives: Dirk Nordmann, Lorenz Pfau and Elke Volkmann \\ndid not stand for re-election. Stefan Scholz also stepped down from \\nthe board on September 1, 2024. The Supervisory Board would \\nlike to thank the departing employee representatives for their valu-\\nable contribution to the work of the Supervisory Board over their \\nmany years of service.

Wolfgang Reitzle \\nChairman \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n16\\n \\nResponsible corporate governance sets the \\nstandard for the Executive Board and the \\nSupervisory Board. \\nGood, responsible corporate governance geared toward sustaina-\\nble, long-term value creation serves as the standard for the Execu-\\ntive Board and Supervisory Board of Continental AG to ensure they \\nact in the interests of all stakeholder groups. The following corporate \\ngovernance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the \\nGerman Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB), to which ref-\\nerence is made in the management report, outlines corporate gov-\\nernance at Continental. The remuneration report for fiscal 2024 on \\nthe remuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board \\ntogether with the auditor’s report and the valid remuneration system \\nfor the remuneration of the Executive Board are available on our \\nwebsite  under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board. \\nThe valid remuneration system for remuneration of the Supervisory \\nBoard is described in the remuneration report for fiscal 2024 and  \\nis available on our website  under Company/Corporate Govern-\\nance/Supervisory Board. \\nDeclaration pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock \\nCorporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG) and deviations from the \\nGerman Corporate Governance Code (Deutscher Corporate \\nGovernance Kodex – DCGK) \\nIn December 2024, the Executive Board and the Supervisory \\nBoard issued the following annual declaration pursuant to Sec-\\ntion 161 AktG:  \\n“The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Continental AG \\ndeclare in accordance with Section 161 German Stock Corporations \\nAct (AktG) that the recommendations of the ‘Government Commis-\\nsion on the German Corporate Governance Code’ in the version \\ndated April 28, 2022 (published by the Federal Ministry of Justice \\nin the official section of the electronic Federal Gazette (Bundes-\\nanzeiger) on June 27, 2022) have been complied with in the re-\\nporting year and will continue to be complied with, with the excep-\\ntion set out below. \\nReference is made to the declaration of the Executive Board and \\nthe Supervisory Board of December 2023 as well as to previous \\ndeclarations in accordance with Section 161 AktG and the devia-\\ntions from the recommendations of the German Corporate Govern-\\nance Code explained therein.  \\nAccording to recommendation C.2 of the German Corporate Gov-\\nernance Code, the Supervisory Board shall set an age limit for \\nmembers of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board does \\nnot set an age limit because it does not consider such a general cri-\\nterion to be appropriate for evaluating the qualifications of a Super-\\nvisory Board member.  \\nHanover, December 2024 \\nProf. Dr.-Ing. Wolfgang Reitzle \\nChairman of the Supervisory Board  \\nNikolai Setzer \\nChairman of the Executive Board” \\nThe declaration of compliance is published on Continental’s web-\\nsite  under Company/Corporate Governance. Earlier declarations \\npursuant to Section 161 AktG can also be found there. Out-of-date \\ncorporate governance statements can also be found there for a pe-\\nriod of at least five years from the date they were issued. \\nKey corporate governance practices \\nThe following documents are key foundations of our sustainable \\nand responsible corporate governance: \\n› Continental AG’s corporate guidelines. The vision, mission and  \\nvalues, desired behavior and self-image of the Continental Group; \\navailable on our website  under Company/Corporate Govern-\\nance/Vision & Mission. \\n› Sustainability ambition; available on our website  under Sustain-\\nability/Framework/Sustainability Ambition. \\n› Compliance with the binding Code of Conduct for all Continental \\nemployees. For more information, see our website  under Sus-\\ntainability/Strategy and Sustainable Corporate Governance/Or-\\nganization and Management. \\nCorporate bodies \\nIn line with the law and the Articles of Incorporation, the company’s \\ncorporate bodies are the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board \\nand the Shareholders’ Meeting. As a German stock corporation, \\nContinental AG has a dual management system characterized by a \\nstrict personnel division between the Executive Board as the man-\\nagement body and the Supervisory Board as the monitoring body. \\nThe cooperation between the Executive Board, Supervisory Board \\nand Shareholders’ Meeting is depicted on the next page.  \\nThe Executive Board and its practices \\nThe Executive Board has sole responsibility for managing the com-\\npany in the interests of the company, free from instructions from \\nthird parties in accordance with the law, the Articles of Incorpora-\\ntion and the Executive Board’s By-Laws, while taking into account \\nthe resolutions of the Shareholders’ Meeting. All members of the \\nExecutive Board share responsibility for the management of the \\ncompany jointly. Regardless of this principle of joint responsibility, \\neach Executive Board member is individually responsible for the  \\nareas entrusted to them. The chairman of the Executive Board is  \\nresponsible for the company’s overall management and business \\npolicy. He ensures management coordination and uniformity on the \\nExecutive Board and represents the company to the public. The  \\nExecutive Board jointly develops the company’s strategy, agrees it \\nwith the Supervisory Board and ensures its implementation. \\nCorporate Governance Statement  \\nPursuant to Sections 289f and 315d  \\nof the German Commercial Code (HGB) \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n 17\\n \\nThe Executive Board had six members as at December 31, 2024, \\nand as at the date of this statement. Information on areas of respon-\\nsibility and resumes of the Executive Board members are available \\non our website  under Company/Corporate Governance/Execu-\\ntive Board. The Executive Board was reduced from seven to six \\nmembers effective July 1, 2024, as the Executive Board function \\nfor Finance and Controlling was combined with that for Integrity \\nand Law. The first time a person is appointed to the Executive Board, \\nhis or her term as a rule is three years only. As a rule, a member of \\nthe Executive Board is not appointed beyond the statutory retire-\\nment age.  \\nOnly under exceptional circumstances will a member of the Execu-\\ntive Board be reappointed earlier than one year prior to the end of \\ntheir term of appointment with simultaneous annulment of their \\ncurrent appointment. More information on the members of the  \\nExecutive Board can be found on page 332 and on our website  \\n under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board. \\nThe Executive Board has By-Laws that regulate in particular the  \\nallocation of duties among the Executive Board members, key mat-\\nters pertaining to the company and its subsidiaries that require a \\ndecision to be made by the Executive Board, the duties of the Execu-\\ntive Board chairman, and the process in which the Executive Board \\npasses resolutions. The Executive Board By-Laws are available on \\nour website  under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive \\nBoard. The Supervisory Board By-Laws on the basis of the Articles \\nof Incorporation require the consent of the Supervisory Board for \\nsignificant actions taken by management. \\n \\n \\nThe Executive Board has established separate boards for the Auto-\\nmotive, Tires and ContiTech group sectors. This supports the de-\\ncentralization of responsibility that the global organization of the \\ncompany seeks to achieve, and relieves the burden on the Execu-\\ntive Board. In addition to establishing these boards, the Executive \\nBoard has delegated to them decision-making powers for certain \\nmatters that affect only the relevant group sectors.  \\nThe boards for the three group sectors each comprise the Execu-\\ntive Board member responsible for the group sector in question as \\ntheir chairman, the heads of the relevant business areas within the \\ngroup sector, as well as further members from among the central \\nfunctions of the relevant group sectors.  \\nThe Supervisory Board and its practices \\nThe Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Executive \\nBoard and collaborates with the Executive Board to develop a long-\\nterm succession plan. The Supervisory Board discusses this topic \\non a regular basis without the Executive Board. In order to become \\nacquainted with potential successors, the Supervisory Board, in \\nconsultation with the Executive Board, offers them the opportunity \\nto introduce themselves to the Supervisory Board. \\nThe Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board \\nin managing the company. This includes, in particular, issues relating \\nto the company’s strategy, planning, business development, risk situ-\\nation, risk management, compliance and sustainability. The Super-\\nvisory Board is directly involved in decisions of material importance \\nto the company. As specified by law, the Articles of Incorporation or \\nthe Supervisory Board By-Laws, certain corporate management \\nmatters require the approval of the Supervisory Board. The chair-\\nman of the Supervisory Board coordinates its work and represents \\nit vis-à-vis third parties. Within reasonable limits, he is prepared to \\ntalk to investors about issues specific to the Supervisory Board. He \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n18\\n \\nmaintains regular contact between meetings with the Executive \\nBoard, and in particular with its chairman, to discuss issues relating \\nin particular to the company’s strategy, business development, risk \\nsituation, risk management and compliance. \\nComposition of the Supervisory Board \\nThe Supervisory Board comprises 20 members in accordance  \\nwith the German Co-determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz – \\nMitbestG) and the company’s Articles of Incorporation. Half the \\nmembers of the Supervisory Board are elected individually by the \\nshareholders in the Shareholders’ Meeting (shareholder representa-\\ntives), while the other half are elected by the employees of Conti-\\nnental AG and its German subsidiaries (employee representatives). \\nBoth the shareholder representatives and the employee represent-\\natives have an equal duty to act in the interests of the company. \\nThe Supervisory Board’s chairman is a shareholder representative. \\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Co-determination Act, he \\nhas the casting vote in the event of a tie.  \\nThe current Supervisory Board was constituted on April 26, 2024. \\nThe term of office of the employee representatives lasts until the \\nend of the 2029 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The term of office \\nof the shareholder representatives varies in accordance with the \\nstaggered board concept introduced in the reporting year. Under \\nthis concept, the terms of office of the shareholder representatives \\ndo not run in parallel; instead, groups of five shareholder representa-\\ntives are elected in staggered cycles for a term of office of four \\nyears. To establish this rhythm of staggered election cycles, five \\nshareholder representatives were elected at the 2024 Annual Share-\\nholders’ Meeting for a one-time term of office of two years, while an \\nadditional five shareholder representatives were elected for a term \\nof office of four years. The increased flexibility in the Supervisory \\nBoard’s composition resulting from this staggered board concept is \\nintended to make it easier for the Supervisory Board to respond to \\nthe changing demands on its tasks and areas of expertise. The \\nchairman of the Supervisory Board is Prof. Dr.-Ing. Wolfgang Reitzle, \\nwho, in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code, \\nis independent of the company and its Executive Board. The Super-\\nvisory Board does not include any members who previously be-\\nlonged to the Executive Board of Continental AG, who exercise an \\nexecutive function or advisory role at a major competitor of Conti-\\nnental, or who have a personal relationship with such a competitor.  \\nThe company has set up an informational program that provides \\nnewly elected members of the Supervisory Board with a comprehen-\\nsive overview of the company’s products and technologies as well as \\nfinances, controlling and corporate governance at Continental.  \\nThe Supervisory Board has drawn up its own By-Laws that supple-\\nment the law and the Articles of Incorporation with more detailed \\nprovisions, including provisions on Supervisory Board meetings, the \\nduty of confidentiality, the handling of conflicts of interest and the \\nExecutive Board’s reporting obligations, and a list of transactions \\nand measures that require the approval of the Supervisory Board. \\nThe Supervisory Board By-Laws are available on our website   \\nunder Company/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board. The  \\nSupervisory Board also consults on a regular basis in the absence \\nof the Executive Board. Before each regular meeting of the Super-\\nvisory Board, the representatives of the shareholders and of the \\nemployees each meet separately with members of the Executive \\nBoard to discuss the upcoming meeting. \\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews how effectively it and its \\ncommittees have fulfilled their responsibilities. It recently carried \\nout such a review in 2021 with the help of an external consultant. \\nThis confirmed the Supervisory Board’s efficient and professional \\napproach to its work in the past years. The Supervisory Board has \\nadopted the recommendations from the 2021 self-assessment. \\nProfile of skills and expertise for the Supervisory Board \\nIn accordance with recommendation C.1 of the German Corporate \\nGovernance Code, the Supervisory Board has prepared a profile of \\nskills and expertise and specified targets for its composition. The \\nSupervisory Board adopted the current profile of skills and exper-\\ntise in February 2024.  \\nThe Supervisory Board as a whole should possess the skills and  \\nexpertise noted below. It is not expected that all Supervisory Board \\nmembers possess all of the skills and expertise noted below. Instead, \\neach area of expertise must be covered by at least one Supervisory \\nBoard member. The profile of skills and expertise assumes that all \\nSupervisory Board members possess the knowledge and skills re-\\nquired for the proper performance of their duties and the charac-\\nteristics necessary for successful Supervisory Board work in an in-\\nternationally active, capital market-oriented company. In particular, \\nthese include integrity, commitment, capacity for discussion and \\nteamwork, sufficient availability and discretion. \\nThe Supervisory Board members should collectively cover all skills, \\nexpertise and experience deemed to be significant in view of Conti-\\nnental’s business activities. These include in particular:  \\n› Skills, expertise and experience related to corporate govern-\\nance, particularly in the areas of:  \\n› Executive board experience \\n› Supervisory board experience  \\n› Strategy and management  \\n› Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) \\n› Organizational development \\n› Strategic personnel planning \\n› Law and compliance \\n \\n› Sector- and company-specific experience, particularly in the \\nareas of: \\n› Industry (i.e. automotive and chemical industries) \\n› IT, software and telecommunications \\n› Mobility services and digital business models \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n 19\\n \\n› International experience, particularly in the regions of:  \\n› Europe \\n› North and South America \\n› China \\n› Asia-Pacific \\n \\n› Skills, expertise and experience in sustainability, particularly in \\nthe areas of: \\n› Environment \\n› Social responsibility \\n \\n› Skills, expertise and experience in risk management and report-\\ning, particularly in the areas of: \\n› Financial and sustainability reporting, control systems \\n› Auditing of financial statements \\n \\nThe Supervisory Board has also specified the following targets for \\nits composition:  \\n› Professional skills and expertise: The personal and profes-\\nsional qualifications defined in the profile of skills and expertise \\nshould be covered as broadly as possible by the candidates pro-\\nposed for election. The progress achieved to date in implement-\\ning the profile of skills and expertise can be viewed in the qualifica-\\ntions matrix. \\n› Independence: The Supervisory Board should have an appropri-\\nate number of members on the shareholder side whom it deems \\nto be independent in accordance with the German Corporate \\nGovernance Code. Taking into account the ownership structure, a \\nSupervisory Board member is therefore considered independent \\nif they are independent of the company and its Executive Board, \\nand also independent of a controlling shareholder. The Supervisory \\nBoard has specified the following targets for this purpose: \\n› More than half of the shareholder representatives should \\nbe independent of Continental AG and its Executive Board. \\nThe independence of shareholder representatives was assessed \\nin accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code by \\nshareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. As part \\nof the assessment of independence from the Executive Board \\nand the company, it was taken into account that four shareholder \\nrepresentatives will have been members of the Supervisory \\nBoard for more than 12 years in 2024. In the assessment of the \\nindependence of these four shareholder representatives, given \\nthe former and ongoing administration of the members in ques-\\ntion, the shareholder representatives overall see no grounds to \\naccept changing the existing assessment of independence. The \\nshareholder representatives currently on the Supervisory Board \\nare therefore all, without exception, independent of Continental AG \\nand its Executive Board.  \\n› At least five shareholder representatives should be inde-\\npendent of the controlling shareholder, the IHO Group, \\nheadquartered in Herzogenaurach, Germany. \\nIt was taken into consideration in the assessment of independ-\\nence from any controlling shareholder that two Supervisory \\nBoard members are linked to the controlling shareholder, the \\nIHO Group, Herzogenaurach, Germany. As determined in the  \\nassessment by the shareholder representatives on the Super- \\nvisory Board, the Supervisory Board still has an appropriate \\nnumber of members on the shareholder side who are independ-\\nent in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code. \\nThese include: \\n› Prof. Dr.-Ing. Wolfgang Reitzle \\n› Dorothea von Boxberg  \\n› Stefan E. Buchner \\n› Dr. Gunter Dunkel \\n› Satish Khatu \\n› Isabel Corinna Knauf \\n› Sabine Neuß \\n› Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher \\n \\n› Term of office: In its nominations for election to the Supervisory \\nBoard, the Supervisory Board as a rule does not nominate candi-\\ndates who at the time of election have already been a member of \\nthe Supervisory Board for 12 years.  \\nIn its nominations of candidates for election to the Supervisory \\nBoard, the Supervisory Board takes into account the requirements \\nof the profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole as well \\nas the aforementioned targets. \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n20\\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n 21\\n8, \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n 22\\n \\nTargets for composition | Independence from the company and Executive Board in accordance with the DCGK  \\nIndependence from  \\ncompany and Executive \\nBoard pursuant to \\nrecommendation C.7 DCGK  \\nIndependence from  \\ncontrolling shareholder  \\npursuant to  \\nrecommendation C.7 DCGK  \\nTerm of office \\nTargets \\nMore than 50% of \\nshareholder representatives \\nAt least five shareholder \\nrepresentatives \\nAs a rule, no election \\nproposal after 12 years in \\noffice \\nYear of appointment \\nProf. Dr.-Ing.

However, the plenum of the Supervisory \\nBoard alone is responsible for stipulating the total remuneration  \\nof the Executive Board members. Another key responsibility of  \\nthe Chairman’s Committee is deciding on the approval of certain \\ntransactions and measures by the company as specified in the \\nSupervisory Board By-Laws. The Supervisory Board has conferred \\nsome of these participation rights on the Chairman’s Committee, \\neach member of which may however, in individual cases, demand \\nthat a matter again be submitted to the plenary session for deci-\\nsion. The members of the Chairman’s Committee are Prof. Dr.-Ing. \\nWolfgang Reitzle (chairman); his vice chairwoman, Christiane Ben-\\nner; Hasan Allak; and Georg F. W. Schaeffler. \\nThe Audit Committee primarily deals with the audit of the accounts, \\nthe monitoring of the accounting process and the effectiveness of \\nthe internal control system, the risk management system and the \\ninternal audit system, the audit of the financial statements (includ-\\ning sustainability reporting and examination thereof) and compli-\\nance. In particular, the committee deals with the preliminary exami-\\nnation of Continental AG’s annual financial statements and the con-\\nsolidated financial statements, and makes its recommendation to \\nthe plenary session of the Supervisory Board, which then passes \\nresolutions pursuant to Section 171 AktG. Furthermore, the com-\\nmittee discusses the company’s draft interim financial reports. It is \\nalso responsible for ensuring the necessary independence of the \\nauditor and deals with additional services performed by the auditor. \\nThe committee engages the auditor, determines the focus of the  \\nreport as necessary, negotiates the fee and regularly reviews the \\nquality of the audit. The chairman of the Audit Committee regularly \\nconsults with the auditor on the progress of the audit and reports \\non this to the committee. The committee also regularly consults \\nwith the auditor without the Executive Board. It also gives its rec-\\nommendation for the Supervisory Board’s proposal to the Annual \\nShareholders’ Meeting for the election of the auditor. The Audit Com-\\nmittee is also responsible for the preliminary audit of non-financial re-\\nporting and sustainability reporting and for the engagement of an \\nauditor for its review, if any. The chairman of the Audit Committee \\nis Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher, who is independent in accordance \\nwith the German Corporate Governance Code. As an auditor with \\nmany years of professional experience in management positions, \\nhe has in-depth knowledge and experience in auditing. Another \\ncommittee member, Klaus Rosenfeld, is also a financial expert, and \\nas chief financial officer in a number of companies has in-depth \\nknowledge and experience in accounting and internal control and \\nrisk management systems. The other members are Francesco Grioli, \\nMichael Iglhaut, Georg F. W. Schaeffler and Matthias Tote. Neither a \\nformer Executive Board member nor the chairman of the Supervisory \\nBoard may act as chairman of the Audit Committee. \\nThe Nomination Committee is responsible for nominating suita-\\nble candidates for the Supervisory Board to propose to the Annual \\nShareholders’ Meeting for election. In addition, the committee must \\npropose targets for the Supervisory Board’s composition and pro-\\nfile of skills and expertise and review both regularly. The Nomina-\\ntion Committee consists entirely of shareholder representatives, \\nspecifically the two members of the Chairman’s Committee, Prof. \\nDr.-Ing. Wolfgang Reitzle (chairman) and Georg F. W. Schaeffler; the \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n 23\\n \\nchairman of the Audit Committee, Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher; and \\nIsabel Corinna Knauf. \\nIn accordance with Section 31 (3) Sentence 1 MitbestG, the Media-\\ntion Committee becomes active only if the first round of voting on \\na proposal to appoint a member of the Executive Board or to re-\\nmove a member by consent does not achieve the legally required \\ntwo-thirds majority. This committee must then attempt mediation \\nbefore a new vote is taken. The members of the Chairman’s Com-\\nmittee are also the members of the Mediation Committee.  \\nThe Committee for Related Party Transactions (RPT Commit-\\ntee) deals with transactions between Continental AG and a related \\nperson, where these transactions require the prior consent of Con-\\ntinental AG’s Supervisory Board in accordance with Sections 111a \\nand 111b AktG. Transactions in this case require the prior consent \\nof the Supervisory Board. In addition to the chairman of the Super-\\nvisory Board, Prof. Dr.-Ing. Wolfgang Reitzle, and the chairman of the \\nAudit Committee, Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher, the Committee for \\nRelated Party Transactions includes two further members elected \\nby the Supervisory Board from among the employee representa-\\ntives where necessary. \\nThe Special Emissions Committee supported the Supervisory \\nBoard’s investigations into the manipulation of emission limits by \\ncertain automotive manufacturers. This committee was available to \\nexternal law firms as a point of contact, source of information and \\nrecipient of reports, regularly reported to the plenary session on \\nthe investigations and prepared resolutions required for the ple-\\nnary session or committees. This special committee was dissolved \\nfollowing the conclusion of its investigations by resolution of the \\nSupervisory Board at its meeting on April 26, 2024. The members \\nof the Special Emissions Committee up until its dissolution were \\nProf. Dr.-Ing. Wolfgang Reitzle, Prof. Dr. Rolf Nonnenmacher and Dirk \\nNordmann.  \\nThe Sustainability Working Group established by the Supervisory \\nBoard deals with sustainability issues relevant to Continental. The \\nworking group includes two shareholder representatives, Dorothea \\nvon Boxberg and Stefan E. Buchner, and two employee representa-\\ntives, Hasan Allak and Jörg Schönfelder.  \\nMore information on the members of the Supervisory Board and its \\ncommittees can be found on pages 333 and 334. Current resumes, \\nwhich are updated annually, are available on our website  under \\nCompany/Corporate Governance/Supervisory Board. They also \\ncontain information on how long each member has held their posi-\\ntion on the Supervisory Board. \\nShareholders and the Shareholders’ Meeting \\nThe company’s shareholders exercise their rights of participation \\nand control at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The Annual Share-\\nholders’ Meeting, which must be held in the first eight months of \\nevery fiscal year, decides on all issues assigned to it by law, such  \\nas the appropriation of profits, the election of shareholder repre-\\nsentatives to the Supervisory Board, the discharging of Supervisory \\nBoard and Executive Board members, the appointment of auditors \\nand the approval of the remuneration system and remuneration  \\nreport. Each Continental AG share entitles the holder to one vote. \\nThere are no shares conferring multiple or preferential voting rights \\nand no limitations on voting rights.  \\nAll shareholders who register in a timely manner and prove their \\nentitlement to participate in the Shareholders’ Meeting and to exer-\\ncise their voting rights are entitled to participate in the Sharehold-\\ners’ Meeting. To facilitate the exercise of their rights and to prepare \\nthem for the Shareholders’ Meeting, the shareholders are fully in-\\nformed about the past fiscal year and the points on the upcoming \\nagenda before the Shareholders’ Meeting by means of the annual \\nreport and the invitation to the meeting. All documents and infor-\\nmation on the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, including the annual \\nreport, are published on Continental’s  website in German and \\nEnglish. Moreover, the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting can also be \\nwatched in full in an audio-visual stream on the company’s website. \\nWhen holding the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the chairperson \\npresiding over the meeting is guided by the fact that an ordinary \\nannual shareholders’ meeting should be concluded after four to six \\nhours. To make it easier for shareholders to exercise their rights, the \\ncompany offers all shareholders who cannot or do not want to ex-\\nercise their voting rights during the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting \\nthemselves the opportunity to vote at the Annual Shareholders’ \\nMeeting via a proxy who is bound by instructions or through ab-\\nsentee voting. The required voting instructions can also be issued \\nto the proxy via an internet service (InvestorPortal) before the end \\nof the general debate on the day of the Shareholders’ Meeting. In \\naddition, the service provider that assists the company with con-\\nducting the Shareholders’ Meeting is instructed not to forward the \\nindividual voting instructions to Continental until the day before the \\nShareholders’ Meeting. \\nAccounting and auditing of financial statements \\nThe Continental Group’s accounting is prepared in accordance with \\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by \\nthe European Union (EU). The annual financial statements of Conti-\\nnental AG are prepared in accordance with the accounting regula-\\ntions of the German Commercial Code. The Annual Shareholders’ \\nMeeting on April 26, 2024, elected PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH \\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Hanover branch (PwC) to audit \\nthe consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2024 as well as the \\ninterim financial reports of the company. Dr. Arne Jacobi is the re-\\nsponsible auditor at PwC. \\nInternal control system and risk management \\nDiligent corporate management and good corporate governance \\nalso require that the company deal with risks responsibly. Continen-\\ntal has a corporate-wide internal control and risk management sys-\\ntem that is used to analyze and manage the company’s risk situation. \\nWe report on this in detail in the report on risks and opportunities \\nstarting on page 76, which forms part of the management report  \\nfor the consolidated financial statements.  \\nTransparent and prompt reporting  \\nAs part of our investor relations and corporate communications, we \\nregularly report to shareholders, analysts, shareholders’ associations, \\nthe media and interested members of the public in equal measure \\non significant developments in the company and its situation. All \\nshareholders have instant access to all the information that is also \\navailable to financial analysts and similar parties. The  website of \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance \\n24\\n \\nContinental AG provides the latest information, including the com-\\npany’s financial reports, presentations held at analyst and investor \\nconferences, press releases and ad-hoc disclosures. The dates of \\nkey periodic publications (annual report, quarterly statements and \\nhalf-year report) and events as well as of the Annual Shareholders’ \\nMeeting and the annual press conference are announced well in \\nadvance in a financial calendar on the  website of Continental AG. \\nFor the scheduled dates for 2025, see the  Investors/Events/ \\nFinancial Calendar section.  \\nReporting pursuant to Section 289f (2) Nos. 4 to 6 HGB \\nPursuant to Section 96 (2) AktG, the Supervisory Board of Conti-\\nnental AG as a listed stock corporation subject to the German Co-\\ndetermination Act consists of at least 30% women and at least 30% \\nmen. This minimum quota must, as a general rule, be fulfilled by \\nthe Supervisory Board as a whole. Due to an objection by the em-\\nployee representatives against the overall fulfillment in accordance \\nwith Section 96 (2) Sentence 3 AktG before the election of the Su-\\npervisory Board in spring 2024, the minimum quota for the Super-\\nvisory Board of Continental AG must be fulfilled separately by the \\nshareholder representatives and the employee representatives. \\nWomen made up 30% of both the shareholder and employee rep-\\nresentatives on the Supervisory Board of Continental AG as at De-\\ncember 31, 2024. \\nFor Continental AG, as a listed stock corporation subject to the Ger-\\nman Co-determination Act, the ratio requirement as set out in Sec-\\ntion 76 (3a) AktG applies, according to which any Executive Board \\ncomposed of more than three persons should have at least one \\nwoman and one man as members of the Executive Board. This re-\\nquirement was met in the fiscal year under review. The Supervisory \\nBoard continues to follow the general debate around the represen-\\ntation of women on executive and supervisory boards and will take \\nany future regulations into account. \\nIn accordance with Section 76 (4) AktG, the Executive Board of \\nContinental AG is required to set targets for the ratio of women in \\nthe first two management levels below the Executive Board and a \\ndeadline for achieving these targets. In December 2021, the Execu-\\ntive Board set new target quotas for women in the first two man-\\nagement levels below the Executive Board at Continental AG for \\nthe period up until December 31, 2026: 37% for the first manage-\\nment level and 33% for the second management level. As at De-\\ncember 31, 2024, the ratio of women was 30% in the first manage-\\nment level and 30% in the second management level. \\nAs a global company, Continental continues to attach high priority \\nto the goal of steadily increasing the proportion of women in man-\\nagement positions throughout the Continental Group, above and \\nbeyond the legal requirements in Germany. \\nDiversity concept \\nContinental counts on the diversity of its employees. The current \\nfocus of its commitment to promote diversity is on internationality \\nand a balanced gender ratio.  \\nThe Supervisory Board also pays attention to the diversity of the \\ncomposition of the Executive Board. The Executive Board does the \\nsame when appointing people to management positions. As a basic \\nprinciple, the Executive Board aims to achieve a balanced ratio of \\ndomestic to international managers everywhere. The proportion  \\nof local and international managers varies according to region. In \\n2024, a total of 46% of the Continental Group’s managers came \\nfrom countries other than Germany (PY: 49%). Continental is also \\nworking on increasing the proportion of women in management \\npositions. In 2024, we were able to increase this number to 21% \\nacross the Continental Group (PY: 20%). The proportion is to be  \\nincreased to 25% by 2025. \\nIn drawing up the Executive Board’s succession plan, the Supervisory \\nBoard together with the Executive Board makes use of the measures \\nand programs to promote internationality and women in manage-\\nment positions, thus making it possible to identify and develop po-\\ntential international candidates and female managers for positions \\non the Executive Board. The aim in the medium term is to use \\nthese measures to increase the diversity of the Executive Board \\neven further.  \\nThe Supervisory Board also pays attention to the diversity of its \\nown composition. For the Supervisory Board, diversity refers to  \\nage, gender, background and professional experience, among other \\nthings. The Supervisory Board is convinced that it will achieve di-\\nversity in its composition in particular by fulfilling the profile of skills \\nand expertise and meeting the targets for its composition. \\n', '25\\nManagement Report\\nGlossary of Financial Terms\\nCorporate Profile\\nStructure of the Continental Group\\nStrategy of the Continental Group\\nCorporate Management\\nSustainability Management\\nResearch and Development\\nEconomic Report\\nGeneral Conditions\\n\\t\\nMacroeconomic Development\\n\\t\\nDevelopment of Key Customer Sectors  \\n\\t\\nand Sales Regions\\n\\t\\nDevelopment of Raw Materials Markets\\nEarnings, Financial and Net Assets Position\\t \\t\\n\\t\\nEarnings Position\\n\\t\\nFinancial Position\\n\\t\\nNet Assets Position\\nDevelopment of the Group Sectors\\n\\t\\nAutomotive\\n\\t\\nTires\\n\\t\\nContiTech\\n\\t\\nContract Manufacturing\\nOverall Statement on the \\nBusiness Performance and Position \\nof the Continental Group\\nContinental AG –  \\nShort Version in Accordance with HGB\\nOther Information\\nDependent Company Report\\nAdditional Disclosures and Notes  \\nPursuant to Sections 289a and 315a HGB\\n\\t\\nRemuneration of the Executive Board\\nCorporate Governance Statement \\nPursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB\\nReport on Risks and Opportunities\\nContinental’s Internal Control and \\nRisk Management System\\nMaterial Risks\\n\\t\\nFinancial Risks\\n\\t\\nRisks Related to the Markets in which  \\n\\t\\nContinental Operates\\n\\t\\nRisks Related to Continental’s  \\n\\t\\nBusiness Operations\\n\\t\\nLegal, Tax and Environmental Risks\\nMaterial Opportunities\\nStatement on Overall Risk\\nand Opportunities Situation\\nReport on Expected Developments\\nFuture General Conditions\\n\\t\\nForecast of Macroeconomic Development\\n\\t\\nForecast for Key Customer Sectors and  \\n\\t\\nSales Regions\\nOutlook for the Continental Group\\nSustainability Report\\nIntroduction\\nCombined Non-Financial Statement\\nGeneral Disclosures\\nEnvironmental Information\\nSocial Information\\nGovernance Information\\nOverviews and Indexes\\nThe following management report is a combined management report as defined in  \\nSection 315 (5) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB), as the  \\nfuture opportunities and risks of the Continental Group and of the parent company,  \\nContinental AG, are inextricably linked.\\n26\\n28\\n28\\n31\\n34\\n37 \\n39\\n43\\n43\\n43\\n43\\n44\\n46\\n47\\n53\\n55\\n59\\n59\\n62\\n64\\n67\\n69\\n70\\n73\\n73\\n73\\n74\\n75\\n76\\n76\\n81\\n81\\n82\\n83\\n85\\n88\\n89\\n90\\n90\\n90\\n90\\n92\\n95\\n95\\n95\\n97\\n118\\n170\\n205\\n211\\nManagement Report\\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Glossary of Financial Terms \\n26\\n \\n \\nThe following glossary of financial terms \\napplies to the management report and the \\nconsolidated financial statements. \\nAdjusted EBIT. EBIT before amortization of intangible assets from \\npurchase price allocation (PPA), changes in the scope of consolida-\\ntion, and special effects. Special effects include: \\n› Impairment on goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant \\nand equipment, and investment property \\n› Income and expenses from restructuring measures \\n› Restructuring-related expenses \\n› Severance payments \\n› Gains and losses from disposals of companies and business oper-\\nations \\n› Other significant special effects from extraordinary events. These \\ninclude one-off effects from acquisitions and disposals of compa-\\nnies and business operations or significant changes to the corpo-\\nrate structure (integration costs, spin-off costs, negative goodwill, \\npurchase price refunds, valuation effects).  \\nSince it eliminates one-off effects, adjusted EBIT can also be used \\nto compare operational profitability between periods. \\nAdjusted EBIT margin. Adjusted EBIT as a percentage of adjusted \\nsales. Since it eliminates one-off effects, the adjusted EBIT margin \\ncan also be used to compare operational profitability between peri-\\nods and, by using a percentage value, to compare specific units. \\nAdjusted free cash flow. Free cash flow adjusted for acquisitions \\nand divestments of companies and business operations. Since it \\neliminates one-off effects, adjusted free cash flow can also be used \\nto compare financial strength between periods. \\nAdjusted sales. Sales adjusted for changes in the scope of  \\nconsolidation. \\nAmerican depositary receipts (ADRs). ADRs securitize the own-\\nership of shares and can refer to one, several or even a portion of a \\nshare. ADRs are traded on US stock exchanges in the place of for-\\neign shares or shares that may not be listed on US stock exchanges. \\nCapital employed. The funds used by the company to generate its \\nsales. \\nCash conversion ratio. Ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net in-\\ncome attributable to the shareholders of the parent. \\nChanges in the scope of consolidation. Changes in the scope of \\nconsolidation include additions and disposals as part of share and \\nasset deals as well as other transactions. Adjustments are made for \\nadditions in the reporting year and for disposals in the comparative \\nperiod of the prior year. \\nContinental Value Contribution (CVC). The absolute amount of \\nadditional value created. The delta CVC represents the change in \\nabsolute value creation compared with the prior year. The delta \\nCVC allows us to monitor the extent to which operating units gen-\\nerate value-creating growth or employ resources more efficiently. \\nThe CVC is measured by subtracting the weighted average cost of \\ncapital (WACC) from the return on capital employed (ROCE) and \\nmultiplying this by the average operating assets for the fiscal year. \\nThe WACC calculated for the Continental Group corresponds to the \\nrequired minimum return. The cost of capital is calculated as the \\nweighted average ratio of the cost of equity and borrowing costs. \\nCurrency swap. Swap of principal payable or receivable in one  \\ncurrency into similar terms in another currency. Often used when \\nissuing loans denominated in a currency other than the functional \\ncurrency of the lender. \\nDerivative instruments. Transactions used to manage interest-\\nrate and/or currency risks. \\nDividend payout ratio. The ratio between the dividend for the  \\nfiscal year and the earnings per share. \\nEBIT. Earnings before interest and tax. In Continental’s financial re-\\nports, this abbreviation is defined as earnings before financial result \\nand tax. It is the result of ordinary business activities and is used to \\nassess operational profitability. \\nEBITDA. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortiza-\\ntion. In Continental’s financial reports, this abbreviation is defined as \\nearnings before financial result, tax, depreciation and amortization. \\nIt equals the sum of EBIT; depreciation of property, plant and equip-\\nment; amortization of intangible assets; and impairment, excluding \\nimpairment on financial investments. This key figure is used to as-\\nsess operational profitability.  \\nFinancial result. The financial result is defined as the sum of inter-\\nest income, interest expense, the effects from currency translation \\n(resulting from financial transactions), the effects from changes in \\nthe fair value of derivative instruments, and other valuation effects. \\nThe financial result is the result of financial activities. \\nFree cash flow. The sum of cash flow arising from operating activi-\\nties and cash flow arising from investing activities. Also referred to \\nas cash flow before financing activities. Free cash flow is used to  \\nassess financial performance. \\nGearing ratio. Net indebtedness divided by equity. Also known as \\nthe debt-to-equity ratio. This key figure is used to assess the financ-\\ning structure.  \\nGross domestic product (GDP). A measure of the economic per-\\nformance of a national economy. It specifies the value of all goods \\nand services produced within a country in a year. \\nHedging. Securing a transaction against risks, such as fluctuations \\nin exchange rates, by entering into an offsetting hedge transaction, \\ntypically in the form of a forward contract. \\nIAS. International Accounting Standards. Accounting standards  \\ndeveloped and resolved by the IASB.  \\nGlossary of Financial Terms \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Glossary of Financial Terms \\n27\\n \\nIASB. International Accounting Standards Board. Independent \\nstandardization committee. \\nIFRIC. International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee \\n(predecessor of the IFRS IC). \\nIFRS. International Financial Reporting Standards. The standards \\nare developed and resolved by the IASB. In a broad sense, they also \\ninclude the IAS, the interpretations of the IFRS IC or of the prede-\\ncessor IFRIC as well as the former SIC. \\nIFRS IC. International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations \\nCommittee. \\nInterest-rate swap. The exchange of interest payments between \\ntwo parties. For example, this allows variable interest rates to be  \\nexchanged for fixed interest or vice versa. \\nNet indebtedness. The net amount of interest-bearing financial  \\nliabilities as recognized in the statement of financial position, the \\nfair values of the derivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents, \\nas well as other interest-bearing investments. This figure is the ba-\\nsis for calculating key figures of the capital structure. \\nOperating assets. The assets less liabilities as reported in the \\nstatement of financial position, without recognizing the net indebt-\\nedness, sale of trade accounts receivable, deferred tax assets, in-\\ncome tax receivables and payables, as well as other financial assets \\nand debts. Average operating assets are calculated as at the end of \\nthe quarterly periods and, according to our definition, correspond \\nto the capital employed. \\nOrganic sales growth. Sales performance of a unit before changes \\nin the scope of consolidation and exchange-rate effects. Therefore \\ndescribes a unit’s performance relying on its own resources. \\nPPA. Purchase price allocation. The process of breaking down the \\npurchase price and assigning the values to the identified assets,  \\nliabilities and contingent liabilities following a business combination. \\nSubsequent adjustments to the opening statement of financial  \\nposition – resulting from differences between the preliminary and \\nfinal fair values at the date of initial consolidation – are also recog-\\nnized as PPA.  \\nRating. Standardized indicator for the international finance markets \\nthat assesses and classifies the creditworthiness of a debtor. The \\nclassification is the result of an economic analysis of the debtor by \\nspecialist rating companies. \\nResearch and development expenses (net). Research and devel-\\nopment expenses (net) are defined as expenses for research and \\ndevelopment less reimbursements and subsidies that we received \\nin this context. \\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE). The ratio of EBIT to average \\noperating assets for the fiscal year. The ROCE corresponds to the \\nrate of return on the capital employed and is used to assess the \\ncompany’s profitability and efficiency. \\nSIC. Standing Interpretations Committee (predecessor of the IFRIC).  \\nTax rate. The ratio of income tax expense to the earnings before \\ntax. It can be used to estimate the company’s tax burden.  \\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equiva-\\nlents after the deduction of cash and cash equivalents that are sub-\\nject to certain restrictions, as is the case, for example, with pledged \\namounts and balances in countries with foreign-exchange restrictions \\nor other barriers to accessing liquidity. Taxes to be paid on the \\ntransfer of cash assets from one country to another are not usually \\nconsidered to represent a restriction on cash and cash equivalents. \\nWeighted average cost of capital (WACC). The weighted aver-\\nage cost of the required return on equity and net interest-bearing \\nliabilities. \\nWorking capital. Inventories plus trade accounts receivable less \\ntrade accounts payable. Sales of trade accounts receivable are not \\nincluded. \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Corporate Profile \\n28\\n \\n \\nAutomotive, Tires and ContiTech: the three \\nstrong pillars of the Continental Group. \\nOrganizational structure  \\nThe Continental Group is divided into four group sectors: Automo-\\ntive, Tires, ContiTech and Contract Manufacturing. Since Novem-\\nber 1, 2024, these have comprised a total of 15 business areas. \\nA group sector or business area with overall responsibility for a \\nbusiness, including its results, is classified according to product  \\nrequirements, market trends, customer groups and distribution \\nchannels. \\nBusiness responsibility \\nOverall responsibility for managing the company lies with the Exec-\\nutive Board of Continental Aktiengesellschaft (AG). The Automotive, \\nTires and ContiTech group sectors are each represented on the  \\nExecutive Board. \\nSpanning the group sectors are the group functions of Continen-\\ntal AG, which are represented by the chairman of the Executive \\nBoard, the chief financial officer and the chief HR officer. These \\nfunctions include Finance and Controlling, Integrity and Law, Com-\\npliance, Internal Audit, Quality Management, Human Relations, Sus-\\ntainability, IT and Group Purchasing. \\nCustomer structure \\nWith a 62% share of consolidated sales, the automotive industry – \\nwith the exception of the replacement business – is our most im-\\nportant customer group. This industry is particularly important for \\nthe growth of the Automotive group sector. In the Tires group sec-\\ntor, sales to dealers and end users represent the largest share of \\nthe tire-replacement business. In the ContiTech group sector, the \\ncustomer base is made up of the energy, agriculture and construc-\\ntion industries, interior design and the automotive and replacement \\nbusinesses. In the Contract Manufacturing group sector, the Schaeffler \\nGroup/Vitesco Technologies (until the merger on October 1, 2024) \\nconstitutes the sole customer. \\nCompanies and locations \\nContinental AG is the parent company of the Continental Group. In \\naddition to Continental AG, the Continental Group comprises 477 \\ncompanies, including non-controlled companies. The Continental \\nteam is made up of 190,159 employees at 518 locations for pro-\\nduction, research and development, and administration in 55 coun-\\ntries and markets. Added to this are distribution locations, with 848 \\ncompany-owned tire outlets and a total of around 5,600 franchises \\nand operations with a Continental brand presence. \\n \\n \\nCorporate Profile \\nStructure of the Continental Group \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Corporate Profile \\n29\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe Automotive group sector offers technologies for safety, \\nbrake, chassis, motion and motion-control systems. Its portfolio also \\nincludes innovative solutions for assisted and automated driving, \\ndisplay and operating technologies, camera solutions for the vehi-\\ncle interior as well as intelligent information and communication \\ntechnology associated with the mobility services of fleet operators \\nand commercial vehicle manufacturers. Comprehensive activities \\nrelating to vehicle connectivity, architecture and electronics, as well \\nas high-performance computers and software solutions, round off \\nthe range of products and services.  \\nSince November 1, 2024, the group sector has been divided into \\nfour business areas: \\n› Architecture and Network Solutions (formerly Architecture and \\nNetworking) \\n› Autonomous Mobility \\n› Safety and Motion \\n› User Experience \\n \\nThe former Software and Central Technologies business area was \\ndiscontinued effective November 1, 2024, and has since been in-\\ncluded in the Automotive group sector. \\nThe Tires group sector offers a premium portfolio of innovative \\ntire solutions for the passenger car, truck, bus, two-wheeler and \\nspecialty segment, as well as intelligent products and services re-\\nlated to tires and the promotion of sustainability. For specialist deal-\\ners and fleet managers, Tires provides digital tire monitoring and \\ntire management systems, in addition to other services, which keep \\nfleets mobile and increase their efficiency. With its tires, the group \\nsector contributes to safe, efficient and environmentally friendly \\nmobility. In the reporting year, 24% of sales in Tires related to busi-\\nness with vehicle manufacturers, and 76% related to the tire-re-\\nplacement business. The group sector is divided into five business \\nareas:  \\n› Original Equipment \\n› Replacement APAC \\n› Replacement EMEA \\n› Replacement The Americas  \\n› Specialty Tires \\nThe ContiTech group sector draws on its materials expertise to \\ndevelop solutions for industrial applications made from rubber, \\nmetal and textiles. Its broad portfolio of hoses, conveyor belts, air \\nsprings and drive belts is designed for the operating conditions  \\nin industrial environments, which can be challenging. At the same \\ntime, ContiTech offers surface materials with an appealing look and \\nfeel for home and vehicle interiors. ContiTech’s industrial growth  \\nareas are primarily in energy, mining, agriculture and construction, \\nas well as exterior and interior design. In the reporting year, 44% of \\nsales in ContiTech related to business with automotive manufactur-\\ners, and 56% to business with other industries and in the automo-\\ntive replacement market.

This applies partic-\\nularly to projects of the Automotive and ContiTech group sectors. \\nIn the Tires group sector, R&D is largely centrally organized, since \\nproduct requirements for tires are much the same across the world. \\nThey are adapted according to the specific requirements of each \\nmarket. Continental generally invests around 7% of sales in R&D \\neach year. For more information, see the Research and Develop-\\nment section. \\nContinental processes a wide range of raw materials and semi- \\nfinished products. The purchasing volume in the reporting year \\nwas €26.6 billion in total, €18.0 billion of which was for production \\nmaterials. Electronics and electromechanical components together \\nmake up around 43% of the Continental Group’s purchasing vol-\\nume for production materials, which are primarily used in the Auto-\\nmotive and Contract Manufacturing group sectors, while mechani-\\ncal components account for around 20%. Natural rubber and oil-\\nbased chemicals as well as synthetic rubber and carbon black are \\nkey raw materials for the Tires and ContiTech group sectors. The  \\ntotal purchasing volume for these materials likewise amounts to \\naround 23% of the total volume for production materials. For more \\ninformation, see the Development of Raw Materials Markets section \\nin the economic report. \\nProduction and sales in the Automotive and ContiTech group sec-\\ntors are organized across regions. For the Tires group sector, econ-\\nomies of scale play a key role when it comes to tire manufacturing. \\nLow production costs coupled with large volumes and proximity to \\nour customers or high rates of regional growth constitute key suc-\\ncess factors. For this reason, manufacturing takes place at major  \\nlocations in the dominant automotive markets, namely Europe, the \\nUSA and China.

At the same time, the Executive Board took \\ndecisive action in response to the constantly and quickly changing \\nconditions faced by our group sectors. In the automotive market in \\nparticular, trends are becoming harder to predict. Examples of this \\ninclude rapid shifts in our customers’ market shares, intense price \\ncompetition and the need for greater agility as part of collaboration \\nwith technology companies. \\nAs a result, and in line with its renewed strategic focus, Continen-\\ntal’s Executive Board decided – after conducting a detailed evalua-\\ntion – to spin off the Automotive and Contract Manufacturing group \\nsectors, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board and the \\nAnnual Shareholders’ Meeting of Continental AG. For Automotive,  \\na spin-off has the potential to create competitive opportunities, in-\\ncrease transparency and enhance agility, which will also benefit in-\\nvestors and partnerships. As a strong, independent entity, Automo-\\ntive will be able to harness its full potential for creating value. The \\nTires and ContiTech group sectors will also benefit from a clearer fo-\\ncus on their respective business areas and their specific challenges. \\nThe following elements were also important in fiscal 2024: \\n› The company continued to invest in particular in those areas  \\nwith value creation upside and continuously expand its technol-\\nogy position in areas where it can expect to gain an edge over \\nthe competition. \\n› The Automotive, Tires and ContiTech group sectors rigorously  \\nimplemented the measures initiated in 2023 to improve perfor-\\nmance, each achieving successes. \\nThese elements build upon the three strategic pillars introduced by \\nContinental in 2020 in response to the transformation in the mobil-\\nity industry and to pave the way for profitable growth. \\n› Strengthening operational performance  \\nBy strengthening its operational performance, Continental can \\nensure its future viability and competitiveness. The company is \\naligning its cost structure to global market conditions. \\n› Differentiating the portfolio  \\nContinental continues to pursue the targeted differentiation of its \\nproduct portfolio with a focus on growth and value. \\n› Turning change into opportunity  \\nThe focus of Continental’s organizational structure helps it to \\nseize market opportunities and translate them into profit even \\nmore quickly. Transparent structures and a high level of auton-\\nomy make the company more flexible in an increasingly complex \\nmarket environment. \\nContinental’s strategic goals are based on its vision: \\nCREATING VALUE FOR A BETTER TOMORROW. \\nOUR TECHNOLOGIES. YOUR SOLUTIONS. POWERED BY THE  \\nPASSION OF OUR PEOPLE. \\n“CREATING VALUE”: Continental aims to create value in everything \\nit does. This can be financial value for its shareholders as well as \\nvalue for its customers, its employees and the social environment  \\nin which it operates. \\n“A BETTER TOMORROW”: With its products and services, Conti-\\nnental contributes to making the world a little better. It develops \\nand produces the mobility of tomorrow in a way that is more con-\\nvenient and comfortable, safer and more sustainable. At the same \\ntime, “a better tomorrow” means acting now and not in the distant \\nfuture. \\n“OUR TECHNOLOGIES. YOUR SOLUTIONS”: Continental is a tech-\\nnology company and believes that it will only be able to tackle the \\nchallenges of our time by rapidly developing the right technologies. \\nContinental’s technology should help its customers make their \\nproducts even better and more useful. Because Continental is cus-\\ntomer-focused in everything it does. \\n“POWERED BY THE PASSION OF OUR PEOPLE”: Continental stands \\nfor a certain culture. A culture of mutual respect. A culture of togeth-\\nerness. And a culture of passion.  \\n \\n \\nStrategy of the Continental Group \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Corporate Profile \\n32\\n \\n \\nAutomotive: focus on value-creating business areas with high \\ngrowth \\nIn the Automotive group sector, Continental continues to focus on \\nvalue-creating business areas with high growth. With its updated \\nstrategy, the group sector aims to systematically increase its profita-\\nbility and competitiveness. The strategy is geared toward achieving \\na leading market position in all business areas, positioning these  \\nareas to achieve maximum efficiency, and becoming the preferred \\nsystem integrator for software-defined vehicles. \\nThe dynamic development of markets and customer requirements \\nin the automotive industry calls for greater flexibility. The Automo-\\ntive group sector’s strategy is based on the three cornerstones \\n“lead – focus – perform” in order to effectively address the future \\nmarket for software-defined and autonomous vehicles. \\n› Lead means striving for a leading market position through out-\\nstanding products and services. \\n› Focus is aimed at actively adapting the product portfolio to \\nchanging market conditions and customer requirements. \\n› Perform is focused on laying a solid foundation for commercial \\nsuccess with efficient structures and a strong financial base. \\nAutomotive was organizationally realigned according to this strat-\\negy. Specifically, expertise in software and high-performance com-\\nputers was consolidated in the Architecture and Network Solutions \\nbusiness area, while commercial vehicle expertise was concentrated \\nin the Autonomous Mobility business area. Furthermore, the Auto-\\nmotive Aftermarket area was integrated into the Safety and Motion \\nbusiness area. \\nContinental is aiming for above-average growth in the Automotive \\ngroup sector compared with the market environment. This is to be \\nachieved by improving the group sector’s market share – in particu-\\nlar among Asian automotive manufacturers, which are growing at a \\ndisproportionate rate – increasing value creation per vehicle and ad-\\njusting prices. In addition, Continental has taken various measures \\nto optimize operational costs and cash inflow. These include in-\\ncreasing efficiency in the manufacture of electronic components, \\nreducing freight costs and optimizing inventory turnover. \\nIndependently of this, Automotive is aiming to reduce costs signifi-\\ncantly by €400 million per year from 2025 by simplifying adminis-\\ntrative structures, reducing the complexity of interfaces and hierar-\\nchy levels, and speeding up decision-making processes. Automotive \\nis also planning to further optimize its use of research and develop-\\nment resources. This will be achieved by consolidating its develop-\\nment locations worldwide, for example. \\nTires: premium tires will continue to create opportunities for \\nprofitable growth \\nIn the Tires group sector, Continental continues to focus on stable \\nearnings from customer-focused solutions as well as operational  \\nexcellence. Sustainable products and solutions, the transformation \\ntoward electric mobility and digital tire services will also create  \\nvarious opportunities for further profitable growth and exceptional \\nvalue creation. The basis for the group sector’s commercial success \\nis its operational efficiency. Capacity and modern production tech-\\nnologies are continually adapted to changing market requirements. \\nThis enables Tires to benefit from major economies of scale and \\nscope, with around 80% of its global production capacity bundled \\nin so-called megafactories. \\nContinental already offers its most sustainable passenger car tire \\non the market as a production tire and is growing in the area of \\ndata-based tire services. In total, it has around 500 original equip-\\nment approvals for supplying fully electric models from automotive \\nmanufacturers worldwide, including the 10 highest-volume manu-\\nfacturers of fully electric cars. \\nThe Tires group sector sees strong growth potential in the Asia- \\nPacific region as well as North and South America. Based on its \\nstrategy of being in the market for the market, production capacity \\nis being expanded accordingly in these regions – such as at the \\nChinese plant in Hefei in 2024. The recovery of the weak demand \\nseen in the reporting year in the original equipment business and \\nthe segment for specialty tires, continuous increases in efficiency, \\nthe ongoing trend worldwide toward larger and higher-performing \\ntires as well as high cost discipline will form the basis for sales and \\nmargin increases. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Corporate Profile \\n33\\n \\nContiTech: group sector strengthens strategic focus on \\nindustrial business \\nIn its ContiTech group sector, Continental is focusing on reliable \\nprofitability thanks to material solutions made from rubber and \\nplastics. At the same time, the group sector is strengthening its \\nstrategic focus on the industrial business and plans to increase the \\nshare of sales accounted for by the industrial business from 56% \\ncurrently to 60% in the medium term. ContiTech’s ambition is to \\nachieve an industrial share of sales of around 80%. This is to be \\nachieved organically through greater penetration of existing and \\nnew markets, systematic expansion of the replacement market \\nbusiness and innovative product portfolio expansions, as well as  \\ninorganically through investments and divestments. \\nContiTech’s industrial growth areas are primarily in energy, mining, \\nagriculture and construction, as well as exterior and interior design. \\nThese industries place high demands on the materials and prod-\\nucts used. The ContiTech group sector benefits here from its high \\nlevel of materials expertise and technological production expertise. \\nIn combination with its broad product portfolio, which includes \\nhigh-performance solutions for hoses, drive belts, conveyor belts \\nand surfaces, ContiTech is well positioned for further profitable \\ngrowth.  \\nAs already announced, the Original Equipment Solutions (OESL) \\nbusiness area – comprising the automotive business of ContiTech, \\nwith the exception of surface solutions for vehicle interiors – will \\nalso be made organizationally independent with a view to its subse-\\nquent sale.  \\nContinental’s strategy forms the basis for its success as a \\ncompany \\nThis strategy forms the basis for strengthening Continental AG \\nmoving forward. All group sectors have introduced extensive \\nmeasures and have a strong product portfolio that is fit for the fu-\\nture. On this basis, Continental’s group sectors (with the exception \\nof Contract Manufacturing) aim to further increase their sales and \\nearnings. Pending the Supervisory Board’s and the Annual Share-\\nholders’ Meeting’s approval of the planned spin-off of Automotive \\nand Contract Manufacturing, the new mid-term targets for Conti-\\nnental and the future Automotive company are expected to be  \\npresented at Capital Market Days in summer 2025. \\nIncrease in value creation \\nWe are confident that the strategic positioning of the Automotive, \\nTires and ContiTech group sectors will lead to long-term success. \\nBy successfully implementing short-term strategic measures to im-\\nprove performance, and with a clear focus on medium and long-term \\ntargets, all group sectors have a balanced and resilient portfolio. \\nConsistently increasing our organizational agility, as well as having \\nclear market positioning and efficient structures, will help to consol-\\nidate our position as the mobility and material technology group \\nfor safe, smart and sustainable solutions. \\nThe decision to potentially spin off Automotive and Contract Manu-\\nfacturing and to strengthen the independence of the Tires and \\nContiTech group sectors are important steps aimed at leveraging \\nour full potential for creating value. \\n \\n \\n', 'Continental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Corporate Profile \\n34\\nThe goal is the sustained increase in the \\nContinental Group’s value.  \\nValue management  \\nValue management at Continental is focused on value creation \\nthrough profitable sales growth. Key financial performance indica-\\ntors are sales, the adjusted EBIT margin, capital expenditure, adjusted \\nfree cash flow and capital employed. For management purposes and \\nto map interdependencies, we use key figures based on these finan-\\ncial performance indicators as part of a value-driver system. Our \\nmid-term corporate objectives center on the sustainable enhance-\\nment of the value of each individual operating unit. This goal is \\nachieved by generating a positive return on the capital employed \\nthat sustainably exceeds the associated equity and debt financing \\ncosts within each individual unit. Crucial to this is that the absolute \\ncontribution to value (the Continental Value Contribution (CVC)) in-\\ncreases year-on-year. This can be achieved by increasing the return \\non capital employed (with the costs of capital remaining constant), \\nlowering the costs of capital (while maintaining the return on capi-\\ntal employed) or decreasing capital employed over time. The perfor-\\nmance indicators used are earnings before income and tax (EBIT), \\ncapital employed and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), \\nwhich is calculated from the proportional weight of equity and debt \\ncosts.  \\nFor 2021, the figures for continuing operations are shown. \\nEBIT is the net total of sales, other income and expenses plus in-\\ncome from equity-accounted investees and from investments but \\nbefore financial result and income tax expense. In the year under \\nreview, EBIT for the Continental Group was €2,287 million.  \\nCapital employed is the funds used by the company to generate its \\nsales. At Continental, this figure is calculated as the average of oper-\\nating assets as at the end of the quarterly reporting periods. In 2024, \\naverage operating assets amounted to €20.0 billion. \\nThe return on capital employed (ROCE) represents the ratio of these \\ntwo calculated values. Comparing a figure from the statement of in-\\ncome (EBIT) with one from the statement of financial position (capi-\\ntal employed) produces an integral analysis. We deal with the prob-\\nlem of the different periods of analysis by calculating the capital \\nemployed as an average figure over the ends of quarterly reporting \\nperiods. The ROCE amounted to 11.4% in 2024.  \\nThe WACC is calculated to determine the cost of financing the capi-\\ntal employed. Equity costs are based on the return from a risk-free \\nalternative investment plus a market risk premium, taking into ac-\\ncount Continental’s specific risk. Borrowing costs are calculated \\nbased on Continental’s weighted debt-capital cost rate. Based on \\nthe long-term average, the cost of capital for our company is about \\n10%.  \\nValue is added if the ROCE exceeds the WACC. We call this value \\nadded, produced by subtracting the WACC from the ROCE multiplied \\nby average operating assets, the Continental Value Contribution \\n(CVC).

The company’s annual invest-\\nment requirements are likely to be around 6% of sales in the com-\\ning years.  \\n \\nOur goal is to finance ongoing investment requirements from the \\noperating cash flow. Other investment projects, such as major ac-\\nquisitions, should be financed from a balanced mix of equity and \\ndebt depending on the ratio of net indebtedness to equity (gearing \\nratio) and the liquidity situation to achieve constant improvement \\nin the respective capital market environment. In general, the gear-\\ning ratio should be below 40% in the coming years. If justified by \\nextraordinary financing reasons or specific market circumstances, \\nwe can rise above this ratio under certain conditions. The equity  \\nratio should exceed 30%. In the reporting year, the equity ratio was \\n40.0% and the gearing ratio was 25.1%. \\nGross indebtedness amounted to €6,909 million as at December 31, \\n2024. Key financing instruments are the syndicated loan with a  \\nrevolving credit line of €4.0 billion that has been granted until De-\\ncember 2026, and bonds issued on the capital market. Our gross \\nindebtedness should be a balanced mix of liabilities to banks and \\nother sources of financing on the capital market. For short-term  \\nfinancing in particular, we use a wide range of financing instruments. \\nAs at the end of 2024, this mix consisted of bonds (56%), a syndi-\\ncated loan (not utilized), other bank liabilities (15%) and other in-\\ndebtedness (29%), based on gross indebtedness. The syndicated \\nloan that was renewed ahead of schedule in December 2019 con-\\nsists of a revolving tranche of €4.0 billion and has an original term \\nof five years. The margin for the loan will also depend on the Conti-\\nnental Group’s sustainability performance. If the Continental Group \\nachieves the performance improvements in sustainability as set out \\nin detail in the loan agreement, this will reduce the margin; non-\\nachievement will result in a margin increase. Continental has exer-\\ncised two options, each extending the term of the loan by one year. \\nThis ensures the financing commitment of the banks until Decem-\\nber 2026.  \\nThe company aims to have at its disposal unrestricted liquidity of \\naround €1.5 billion. This is supplemented by committed, unutilized \\ncredit lines from banks in order to cover liquidity requirements at \\nall times. These requirements fluctuate during a calendar year ow-\\ning in particular to the seasonal nature of some business areas. In \\naddition, the amount of liquidity required is also influenced by cor-\\nporate growth. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents amounted \\nto €2,720 million as at December 31, 2024. There were also com-\\nmitted and unutilized credit lines of €4,966 million.  \\nAs at December 31, 2024, the revolving credit line of €4.0 billion \\nhad not been utilized. Around 56% of gross indebtedness is financed \\non the capital market in the form of bonds. The interest coupons \\nvary between 0.375% and 4.000% p.a. In 2024, Continental re-\\ndeemed a maturing bond in the amount of €625 million. In con-\\njunction with this, and in order to optimize the maturity profile of its \\nindebtedness, Continental issued one new bond in October 2024. \\nThis bond with a volume of €600 million, an interest rate of 3.500% \\np.a. and a term of five years was placed with investors. In addition \\nto the forms of financing already mentioned, there were also bilat-\\neral credit lines with various banks in the amount of €2,034 million \\nas at December 31, 2024. Continental’s corporate financing instru-\\nments currently also include sale-of-receivables programs and com-\\nmercial paper programs. As in the previous year, Continental had \\ntwo commercial paper programs in Germany and the USA in 2024. \\nWhile the program in Germany had been utilized at the end of \\n2024 in the nominal amount of €310 million, the program in the \\nUSA had not been utilized. \\n \\n \\n1,042\\n3,861\\n2,005\\nComposition of gross indebtedness (€6,909 million)\\nBank liabilities\\nOther liabilities\\nBonds\\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Corporate Profile \\n36\\n \\nMaturity profile \\nContinental strives for a balanced maturity profile, particularly with \\nrespect to its capital market liabilities, in order to be able to repay \\nthe amounts due each year from free cash flow as far as possible. \\nAside from short-term indebtedness, most of which can be rolled \\non to the next year, one bond in the amount of €600 million will \\nmature in 2025.

Along with the relevant guide-\\nlines, this ambition constitutes the framework for existing manage-\\nment approaches, strategies, programs, processes and targets, as \\nwell as their further development. In our four focus areas of sustain-\\nability, we are committed to strong, visionary ambitions, which we \\nwant to achieve by 2050 at the latest, together with our partners \\nalong the value chain: \\n› Carbon neutrality  \\nWe strive for 100% carbon neutrality along our entire value chain \\n(products, operations and supply chain). \\n› Emission-free mobility and industry  \\nWe strive for 100% emission-free mobility and industry. “Emis-\\nsion-free” refers to zero emissions of greenhouse gases and nitro-\\ngen oxides (NOx), for example. It does not include harmless emis-\\nsions such as steam, non-toxic, biodegradable particle emissions \\nor minimal noise emissions. \\n› Circular economy  \\nWe strive for 100% closed resource and product cycles. \\n› Responsible value chain  \\nWe strive for 100% responsible sourcing and business partner-\\nships along the value chain. \\nThe specific management approaches, strategies, programs, pro-\\ncesses and targets are presented in a separate dedicated section  \\nof this management report, the sustainability report, starting on \\npage 95. The entire ambition can be found on our website at  \\n www.continental-sustainability.com. \\nResponsibility and Management \\nThe Sustainability Steering Committee of the Continental Group is \\nresponsible for assessing cross-functional issues, weighing up op-\\nportunities and risks and discussing relevant Executive Board deci-\\nsions in advance. In fiscal 2024, it consisted of the entire Executive \\nBoard, Group Sustainability and other functions at group and group-\\nsector level. The committee is chaired by the Executive Board \\nmember for Group Human Relations (director of Labor Relations) \\nand Group Sustainability and managed by the head of the Group \\nSustainability group function. \\nThe Executive Board, senior executives and executives worldwide \\nare measured against progress made using specific sustainability \\nindicators. Long-term remuneration components are thus also \\nlinked to sustainability aspects. The long-term incentive plans (LTI \\nplans) are updated on an annual basis, meaning the sustainability \\nindicators used for the plans differ. In addition, a sustainability indi-\\ncator was integrated into short-term remuneration for 2024. The \\nindicators used thus formally represent the remuneration-related, \\nmanagement-relevant indicators relating to sustainability. \\nFor detailed information on the remuneration system, see the re-\\nmuneration report on our website  under Company/Corporate \\nGovernance/Executive Board.  \\nFurther information on sustainability indicators and their collection \\ncan be found in the sustainability report in a separate section of \\nthis management report. \\nThe most significant key performance indicators for the Continen-\\ntal Group consist of financial indicators and can be found in this \\nmanagement report: in the Corporate Management section of the \\ncorporate profile and in the Outlook for the Continental Group sec-\\ntion of the report on expected developments. \\nIntangible Resources \\nIntangible resources represent a crucial foundation for Continen-\\ntal’s value generation and are therefore essential to its business \\nmodel. A number of high-value, non-financial factors are considered \\nto be intangible resources. These are also partially recognized in \\nthe consolidated financial statements and include in particular: \\n› Innovative strength  \\nContinental’s research and development activities and the result-\\ning innovative strength are a driver for success in constantly \\nchanging markets. For more information, please refer mainly to \\nthe Strategy of the Continental Group and Research and Develop-\\nment sections and also to the consolidated financial statements, \\nparticularly under goodwill and other intangible assets. \\n› Management processes, production methods and processes \\nContinental has developed various business models to be suc-\\ncessful in the market.

The use of sustainable materials in the production of tires is \\nalso attracting a lot of interest. These developments are geared to \\nproviding specially customized solutions – market-specific, tailor-\\nmade and modular. Another growing trend is that automotive inte-\\nriors are being used for a wider range of purposes. These findings \\nare incorporated directly into Continental’s research and develop-\\nment strategies in order to respond to customers’ ever-evolving  \\nrequirements. \\nContinental is a driving force of automotive R&D excellence \\nThe comprehensive strategy program “R&D Excellence” aims to re-\\nduce the research and development ratio of the Automotive group \\nsector to below 10% of sales by 2027 and bring together develop-\\ners at the highest level with a focus on effectiveness, efficiency and \\nexcellence. To achieve this, the program is designed to prioritize \\nmeasures with the greatest impact and clear objectives. Significant \\nprogress was already made in 2024 in terms of the operating cost \\nbase, and implementation has picked up speed in all four pillars de-\\nfined for the project: software excellence, project execution, foot-\\nprint optimization, and specific measures within the business areas. \\nThe research and development teams in the Automotive group \\nsector actively contribute ideas for improvement. Automotive is \\npromoting R&D excellence as a way to rethink its operations and \\nstructural setup. The feedback of both developers and vehicle man-\\nufacturers is incorporated for this purpose, with a focus on driving \\ntechnological progress. \\nContinental Holistic Motion Control software – first order from \\nChina \\nThe Automotive group sector has received its first order for its \\nnewly developed “Holistic Motion Control” software – a decisive \\nstep toward industrializing the software-defined vehicle. The soft-\\nware decouples the driving functions for manual, assisted and au-\\ntonomous driving from the hardware, paving the way for hardware-\\nindependent software functions and innovations. This is possible \\nthroughout the entire service life of a vehicle, with new function  \\nupdates rolled out over the air. \\nThe software package is scheduled to be launched on the market \\nin 2025 as a pilot project in collaboration with a major Chinese  \\nautomotive manufacturer and is already being scaled for multiple \\nplatforms and new customers. Holistic Motion Control can also be \\nmarketed as a stand-alone product. This cuts down on development \\ncosts and taps into potential new markets for the automotive soft-\\nware business. It complements the broad-based hardware and sys-\\ntem business and gives Continental a decisive edge over the com-\\npetition when it comes to the software-defined vehicle. \\nContinental makes advances in server-based vehicle \\narchitectures with zone control units \\nWith the introduction of its zone control units (ZCUs) for European \\nand Asian car manufacturers, Continental has taken a decisive step \\ntoward server-based vehicle architectures. ZCUs form the middle \\nlayer of the electric and electronic architecture of software-defined \\nvehicles. They enable decentralized power supply and support the \\nseparation of hardware and software. Thanks to its modular devel-\\nopment platform, Continental is able to start production just over  \\na year after receiving an order, accelerating the rollout of software-\\ndefined vehicles. ZCUs optimize data management by consolidat-\\ning electronic connections within specific vehicle zones, reducing \\nweight and complexity, and at the same time facilitating over-the-air \\nsoftware updates. This innovative architecture cuts down on the \\nhigh number of individual electronic control units, simplifies cabling \\nand minimizes CO2 emissions.  \\nBy carrying over proven software across models, Continental has \\nreduced the time and effort needed for validation, ultimately also \\naccelerating the time to market. ZCUs were developed to help cus-\\ntomers manage and minimize complexity and smooth the transition \\nto more advanced vehicle architectures. Given the ongoing poten-\\ntial to enhance the efficiency of software-defined vehicle architec-\\ntures, this solution will become more and more relevant in the future. \\nTransparent tech: Invisible Biometrics Sensing Display \\nmonitors passengers’ vital signs \\nWith its new Invisible Biometrics Sensing Display, Continental has \\nintroduced an innovation in display technology that tracks the vital \\nsigns of persons inside the vehicle using a camera and a laser dot \\nprojector to support a wide range of safety and comfort features. \\nWhat is special about the technology is that it is concealed out of \\nsight behind the OLED display and can see through the screen it-\\nself. This boosts acceptance among users and unlocks new creative \\npossibilities for designers of car interiors. In addition to its compre-\\nhensive driver monitoring functionalities, the solution offers new \\nsafety features such as 3D distance mapping for driver and passen-\\ngers, providing optimized airbag deployment and reliable seat belt \\ndetection. Biometric image analysis also makes it possible to meas-\\nure vital signs such as heart rate to identify stressful situations or \\nan impending medical emergency – situations where every second \\ncounts. The Invisible Biometrics Sensing Display, which was devel-\\noped in technological partnership with trinamiX, a leading provider \\nof biometric solutions and subsidiary of BASF SE, was a CES Inno-\\nvation Award Honoree in November 2024. \\n \\n \\nResearch and Development \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Corporate Profile \\n40\\n \\nContinental receives CLEPA Innovation Award \\nContinental was awarded the prestigious CLEPA Innovation Award \\n2024 for outstanding technological achievements in the field of au-\\ntomotive software development. CLEPA, the European Association \\nof Automotive Suppliers, presented the award in the “Digital” cate-\\ngory to the Smart Cockpit High-Performance Computer Virtualiza-\\ntion, a cloud-based solution that is revolutionizing the development \\nof vehicles. This award highlights Continental’s dedication to en-\\nhancing future mobility, making it safer, more efficient and more \\nsustainable through pioneering technologies. The virtualization so-\\nlution makes it possible to start software development using virtual \\nelectronic control units (vECUs) before the hardware – e.g. for mi-\\ncrocontrollers or processors – is even available. This allows the de-\\nvelopment of hardware and software to run largely independently \\nof each other and at the same time in parallel, significantly reduc-\\ning development time and making it easier to identify potential \\nproblems early on in the development process. \\nThe solution is based on the vECU Creator, which is part of Conti-\\nnental’s cloud-based Automotive Edge framework (CAEdge). CAEdge \\nprovides a state-of-the-art virtual environment for fast and flexible \\nsoftware development and supports a number of different operat-\\ning systems, including Android and Linux. This solution is instru-\\nmental in enabling the continuous development and integration of \\nnew features for improved safety and a better driving experience \\nover the entire life cycle of a vehicle. \\nContinental introduces cross-domain high-performance \\ncomputers and CAEdge software-defined vehicles \\nContinental has successfully deployed a pioneering cross-domain \\nhigh-performance computer (HPC) in a car, showcasing the capabil-\\nity of software-defined vehicles (SDVs). This innovative HPC inte-\\ngrates cockpit functions and advanced functions for driving safety \\nand automated parking. It is also a tangible example of how Conti-\\nnental’s cloud-based software development framework CAEdge can \\nbe applied in practice. \\nThe collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies meant that devel-\\nopers were able to use the Snapdragon Ride Flex system-on-a-chip, \\noptimizing both costs and performance.

Developers have suc-\\nceeded in reducing the tire’s rolling resistance by 10% compared \\nwith its predecessor within the EU tire label Class A. As a steering-\\naxle tire, it is also the first long-haul tire in size 315/70 to enable  \\nan axle load capacity of 8.5 metric tons, making it ideal for electric \\ntrucks. The original-equipment tire for long-distance applications \\nsets new standards in energy efficiency and boosts battery range. \\nThe tread’s special rubber compound combined with the tire’s rigid \\nprofile help to reduce rolling resistance, which in turn extends mile-\\nage by around 5% compared with the predecessor model. The tire’s \\nprofile provides a secure grip and superior tracking, and the tire it-\\nself has extremely quiet external rolling noise (EU tire label Class A). \\nContinental, DT Swiss and Swiss Side partner to develop \\nwheel-tire system featuring crosswind-taming AERO 111 \\nbicycle tire \\nContinental has partnered with class-leading cycling brands DT \\nSwiss and Swiss Side to create the ultimate wheel-tire system (WTS) \\nfor both enthusiast and pro riders looking to gain every marginal \\nadvantage in pursuit of performance. The collaboration has re-\\nsulted in an innovative front-wheel-specific tire: the AERO 111. \\nContinental’s most aerodynamic tire yet, the AERO 111 deploys a \\npatented tread incorporating 48 cavities that are equally distrib-\\nuted over the tire surface. These innovative cavities act as vortex \\ngenerators that control the turbulence of the air as it hits the front \\nwheel. This action promotes the adherence of airflow to the front \\nwheel rim profile and delays flow separation, maximizing the sailing \\neffect. The AERO 111 uses Continental’s race-optimized Black Chili \\ntire compound to ensure exceptional rolling resistance and grip in \\nboth wet and dry conditions, while Active Comfort Technology  \\nabsorbs vibrations for a smooth ride. \\nContinental offers automated and continuous tread depth \\nmeasurement for commercial-vehicle tires \\nContinental is offering automated tread depth measurements for \\ntires thanks to its latest generation of ContiConnect sensors. For \\nthe first time, fleet operators are now able to obtain precise and \\ndaily updated data on the rate of wear of their commercial-vehicle \\ntires. Backed by AI-based algorithms, the sensors allow operators  \\nto precisely plan the tire services needed for individual commercial \\nvehicles, as well as for their entire fleet. This increases the safety \\nand efficiency of the fleet, saves costs and helps to reduce CO2 \\nemissions. \\nThe sensor measures changes in the tire’s radial acceleration. The \\nmore flexible the rubber of the tread, the shallower the tread depth. \\nThis data is used to draw conclusions about the changed rolling be-\\nhavior of the tire and therefore about the tire wear. In turn, the AI \\nutilizes the tire specifications and tire mileage, taking vehicle-specific \\nfactors into account. Based on these, it predicts the tread depth of \\nthe tire and the expected tire mileage. The new tread depth meas-\\nurement and the tire service planning complement Continental’s \\nexisting ContiConnect solution portfolio, which already includes \\ndata on tire pressure, temperature and mileage. \\nTop marks for Continental passenger-car tires in independent \\npress tests \\n2024 saw Continental’s summer, winter and all-season tires un-\\ndergo 82 tests by independent trade media worldwide – all of \\nwhich confirmed them as a good and safe choice. This was sup-\\nported by an internal analysis in early February 2025. In the tests \\npublished this year, Continental’s passenger-car tires placed in the \\ntop three in all segments 63 times. The PremiumContact 7 took \\nfirst place in 19 out of 22 publications. A key reason behind these \\naccolades is the tire’s outstanding safety, with the PremiumContact \\n7 achieving significantly shorter braking distances on wet and dry \\nroads than its competitors. Germany’s ADAC also gave the tire top \\nmarks in the environment category thanks to its good mileage. \\nThe WinterContact TS 870, developed by Continental especially for \\nsmall and mid-sized cars, impressed in the winter tire tests by the \\nADAC, Auto Bild and the British trade magazine Auto Express.  \\nContinental’s AllSeasonContact 2 performed extremely well in this \\nyear’s all-season tire tests: Germany’s ACE Auto Club Europa, which \\ntested the “all-rounder” in winter and summer together with the \\ntesting organization GTÜ and Austria’s ARBÖ, crowned it test win-\\nner with the rating “highly recommended.” It also emerged victori-\\nous in tests conducted by Autozeitung and sport auto as well as \\nBritish online publication Tyre Reviews. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Corporate Profile \\n42\\n \\nContinental unveils sustainable surface solutions for the \\nvehicle interior \\nThe surface specialists in the ContiTech group sector are pursuing \\nsustainability ambitions with a focus on carbon neutrality and a \\nclosed circular economy, supported by innovative materials like \\nXpreshn that are used in the vehicle interior. This product can be \\nsupplied with a product carbon footprint (PCF) of 0, meaning that \\nthe volume of CO2 released during manufacture is canceled out by \\nthe volume that is removed from the atmosphere. The material \\nuses bio-based and recycled raw materials. As a thermoplastic \\nmonomaterial, Xpreshn can be fully recycled when it reaches the \\nend of its life and the recyclate can be integrated into existing cus-\\ntomer processes. In addition, the material weighs up to 60% less \\nthan standard materials and is also available in a vegan variant  \\ncertified by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals).  \\nNew rubber compound for Continental air springs cuts carbon \\nfootprint by more than a third \\nWith its TOUGH RUNR air springs, the ContiTech group sector has \\ndeveloped an alternative to conventional air springs that is efficient \\nand resistant to aging across an extremely broad temperature \\nrange. In addition, TOUGH RUNR’s product carbon footprint (PCF) \\nhas been reduced by more than a third compared with an air \\nspring based on synthetic rubber. The vast majority of air springs \\nused in commercial vehicles are manufactured either from heat \\nand ozone-resistant chloroprene, a synthetic rubber, or from cold-\\nresistant natural rubber. For TOUGH RUNR, Continental developed \\na rubber compound consisting of natural rubber strengthened by \\nespecially high-performance ethylene propylene diene monomer \\n(EPDM). The result: air springs that boast a combination of ecologi-\\ncal properties and adaptability to climatic conditions. \\nFor two years, TOUGH RUNR has been factory-fitted in the trucks of \\na major European commercial vehicle manufacturer.

Inflation eased gradually in most \\nregions, while productivity and structural reform remained sluggish. \\nAccording to the January 2025 World Economic Outlook Update \\n(WEO Update) published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \\nthe global economy grew by 3.2% in fiscal 2024, which slightly  \\nexceeded the IMF’s forecast of 3.1% growth from January 2024. \\nAccording to statistical office Eurostat, gross domestic product \\n(GDP) in the eurozone rose by 0.7% year-on-year in 2024. For \\nFrance and Italy, the IMF recorded growth rates of 1.1% and 0.6%, \\nrespectively, while Spain’s economy grew by 3.1%. Conversely, GDP \\nin Germany fell by 0.2% according to the Federal Statistical Office. \\nThe United Kingdom achieved growth of 0.9% according to the \\nIMF, thus slightly outperforming the eurozone. \\nIn North America, the USA posted GDP growth of 2.3% in 2024, ac-\\ncording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. For Canada and Mexico, \\nthe IMF recorded GDP growth of 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively. Other \\ncountries in the Americas also saw continued economic recovery \\nin 2024. For Brazil, for example, the IMF estimated GDP growth of \\n3.7%.  \\nAsian countries also recorded a continued economic revival in the \\nyear under review, according to the IMF. Significant growth was \\nachieved in 2024 by India’s economy, with GDP growth of 6.5%,  \\nby China, with growth of 4.8%, and by the Association of Southeast \\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), with GDP growth of 4.5%. According to the \\nIMF, a negative growth rate was reported for Japan, with a 0.2%  \\ndecline in GDP. \\nDevelopment of Key Customer Sectors \\nand Sales Regions \\nWith a 62% share of consolidated sales (PY: 64%), the automotive \\nindustry – with the exception of the replacement business – was \\nContinental’s most important customer group in fiscal 2024. The \\nAutomotive group sector accounted for the lion’s share, but the \\nTires and ContiTech group sectors also generated significant sales \\nfigures in this market segment. \\nThe second-biggest market segment for Continental was the global \\nreplacement-tire business for passenger cars and commercial vehi-\\ncles, with 27% of total sales in fiscal 2024 (PY: 25%). Because pas-\\nsenger cars and light commercial vehicles make up a considerably \\nhigher share of the replacement-tire business, their development is \\nparticularly important to our economic success.  \\nThe third-biggest market segment for Continental was the global \\nbusiness with industrial customers and spare parts from the Conti-\\nTech group sector, with around 9% of total sales (PY: 9%). \\nContinental’s biggest sales region in the reporting year was again \\nEurope, which accounted for 49% of sales (PY: 48%), followed by \\nNorth America at 26% (PY: 27%) and Asia-Pacific at 21% (PY: 21%). \\nDevelopment of new passenger-car registrations \\nIn 2024, the number of new passenger-car registrations increased \\nin most major international automotive markets. Regional differ-\\nences were still evident, however, particularly in terms of new regis-\\ntrations of electric vehicles as government subsidies were reduced \\nor discontinued. The availability of many car models continued to \\nimprove year-on-year, while the market launch of new series by \\nmanufacturers was pushed back. Geopolitical and macroeconomic \\nuncertainties and high consumer prices led to ongoing subdued \\ndemand in many relevant markets. \\nAccording to preliminary data from the German Association of the \\nAutomotive Industry (Verband der Automobilindustrie, VDA), 13.0 \\nmillion new vehicles were registered in the European car market \\n(EU27, EFTA and the United Kingdom) in 2024, around 1% more \\nthan in the previous year. In Germany, 1% fewer car models were \\nregistered in 2024. The USA recorded a slight rise in new vehicle \\nregistrations, up by 2%; in Brazil, the rise was significantly higher  \\nat 14%. Passenger car sales fell by around 7% in Japan. \\nIn China – the world’s largest car market – the VDA recorded growth \\nin 2024. The number of newly registered vehicles rose by 6% to \\n23.0 million units, slightly outperforming the Chinese economy as \\na whole. In India, sales of new vehicles were up 4% to 4.3 million \\nunits in 2024.  \\nDevelopment of production of passenger cars and light \\ncommercial vehicles \\nChallenging economic conditions and a lack of predictability in \\nterms of funding structures curbed purchases of cars and light \\ncommercial vehicles weighing less than 6 metric tons industry-\\nwide in 2024. Production figures fell as a result, although some \\nnew high-volume models were still in the start-up phase. At the \\nsame time, certain models were discontinued by traditional manu-\\nfacturers. Newer brands from Asia and North America benefited \\nfrom this the most.  \\nAccording to preliminary data, Europe and North America recorded \\na 5% and 1% decline, respectively, in the production of passenger \\ncars and light commercial vehicles in the reporting year. China in-\\ncreased its production by 4% in 2024.  \\nAccording to preliminary figures, global production for 2024 fell by \\n1% to 89.5 million units. \\nDevelopment of production of medium and heavy commercial \\nvehicles \\nThe production of medium and heavy commercial vehicles weigh-\\ning more than 6 metric tons fell year-on-year in our core European \\nmarket in the reporting period due to the weak economic environ-\\nment, high inflation and high energy costs. Preliminary figures indi-\\ncate that production volumes for medium and heavy commercial \\nvehicles fell by 22% year-on-year. \\nEconomic Report \\nGeneral Conditions  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Economic Report \\n44\\n \\n \\nIn our other core market of North America, high financing costs \\nand a fall in demand in the reporting year led to a 4% decline in \\nproduction figures compared with the high level seen in 2023. \\nDevelopment of replacement-tire markets for passenger cars \\nand light commercial vehicles \\nAfter a weak start to 2024, sales in the replacement business im-\\nproved in Europe from April onward. Demand continued to pick up \\nover the course of the year, partly due to tire dealers reducing their \\ninventories in 2023. Following a strong first quarter, the market in \\nNorth America performed moderately overall. By contrast, the re-\\nplacement-tire market in China remained buoyant after a strong \\nyear in 2023. The markets trended further upward in the second \\nhalf of the year – boosted in particular by strong business in Europe \\non the back of demand for winter tires. \\nSales volumes of replacement tires for passenger cars and light \\ncommercial vehicles weighing less than 6 metric tons rose by 7% \\nin Europe (excluding Russia) for 2024 as a whole. In North Amer-\\nica, demand in the year under review was slightly higher than in \\nthe previous year, increasing by 2%. Positive growth was also rec-\\norded in China, with a rise of 1%. According to preliminary data, \\nglobal sales volumes of replacement tires for passenger cars and \\nlight commercial vehicles rose by 3% in the reporting year.  \\nDevelopment of replacement-tire markets for medium and \\nheavy commercial vehicles \\nIn our core market of Europe (excluding Russia), preliminary data \\nfor 2024 indicates that demand for replacement tires for medium \\nand heavy commercial vehicles weighing more than 6 metric tons \\nwas on a par with the previous year. In North America, however,  \\ndemand rose by 7% year-on-year. \\nDevelopment of industrial production \\nIn addition to vehicle production and the replacement business for \\nthe automotive industry, the development of various other indus-\\ntries is crucial to the success of our ContiTech group sector. Conti-\\nTech products are used in particular in equipment, machinery and \\nvehicles for railway transport, mining, agriculture and other key in-\\ndustries. As well as the general development of gross domestic \\nproduct, the development of industrial production is therefore re-\\ngarded as an important indicator for ContiTech’s business with in-\\ndustrial customers.  \\nIn the reporting period, industrial production in the eurozone con-\\ntinued to be affected by increased costs and the weak economic \\nenvironment, sliding year-on-year as a whole. In the USA as well, in-\\ndustrial production was down slightly on the prior-year level. China, \\non the other hand, recorded growth in industrial production com-\\npared with the previous year, influenced by economic stimulus \\npackages and other factors.  \\nDevelopment of Raw Materials Markets \\nRaw materials markets remained largely stable in the reporting \\nyear due to a continued improvement in availability. The normaliza-\\ntion of global supply chains was also reflected in less volatile price \\ndevelopments, particularly for metals and crude oil. Nevertheless, \\nthere were significant price increases for individual raw materials \\nsuch as precious metals, natural rubber and butadiene. This was at-\\ntributable to ongoing geopolitical risks and a lack of availability. \\nCarbon steel and stainless steel are input materials for many of the \\nmechanical components such as die-cast parts integrated by Conti-\\nnental into its products. Steel wire is used in particular in tire pro-\\nduction as steel cord but also in conveyor belts and timing belts to \\nincrease tensile strength. Aluminum is used in particular for die-cast \\nparts and stamped and bent components, while copper is used in \\nparticular in electric motors, mechatronic components and printed \\ncircuit boards. \\n \\nChanges to vehicle production, the tire-replacement business and industrial production in 2024 (compared with 2023) \\nPassenger cars and light \\ncommercial vehicles \\nVehicle production \\nTire-replacement \\nbusiness \\n  \\n  \\nIndustrial production \\nEurope \\n–5% \\n7%   Eurozone \\n–2.9% \\nNorth America \\n–1% \\n2%   USA \\n–0.3% \\nChina \\n4% \\n1%   China \\n5.4% \\nWorldwide \\n–1% \\n3% \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\nMedium and heavy  \\ncommercial vehicles \\nVehicle production \\nTire-replacement \\nbusiness \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nEurope \\n–22% \\n0%   \\n  \\n  \\nNorth America \\n–4% \\n7%   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPreliminary data.  \\nSources:  \\nVehicle production: S&P Global (Europe with Western, Central and Eastern Europe incl.

Before changes in \\nthe scope of consolidation and exchange-rate effects, sales declined \\nby 2.6%. Exchange-rate effects dented sales performance by €610 \\nmillion, while changes in the scope of consolidation had only a neg-\\nligible impact.  \\nFaced with a continued challenging market environment and de-\\nclining vehicle production, especially in Europe, the Automotive \\ngroup sector recorded a drop in sales. This decline was mitigated \\nby targeted price adjustments made to offset inflation-related cost \\nincreases. Sales in the Tires group sector contracted slightly on the \\nback of negative exchange-rate effects and weak demand in the \\npassenger-car original-equipment business, but were propped up \\nby growth in the global tire-replacement markets and continued \\npositive effects from the product mix. The downtrend in the auto-\\nmotive original-equipment business in Europe and North America \\ncombined with persistently weak markets, particularly in the in-\\ndustrial segment, likewise depressed sales in ContiTech. Contract \\nManufacturing reduced its sales in accordance with the contractu-\\nally agreed procedure between Continental and the Schaeffler \\nGroup/Vitesco Technologies (until the merger on October 1, 2024). \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Economic Report \\n48\\n \\n \\nThe regional distribution of sales in 2024 was as follows: \\n \\nSales by region in % \\n2024 \\n2023 \\nGermany \\n20 \\n19 \\nEurope excluding Germany \\n30 \\n29 \\nNorth America \\n26 \\n27 \\nAsia-Pacific \\n21 \\n21 \\nOther countries \\n4 \\n4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAdjusted EBIT \\nAdjusted EBIT for the Continental Group increased by €168 million \\nor 6.6% year-on-year in 2024 to €2,694 million (PY: €2,526 million), \\ncorresponding to 6.8% (PY: 6.1%) of adjusted sales. \\nEBIT \\nEBIT was up by €433 million year-on-year in 2024 to €2,287 million \\n(PY: €1,854 million), an increase of 23.4%. The return on sales im-\\nproved to 5.8% (PY: 4.5%). The cost of sales fell by €1,694 million  \\nto €30,918 million (PY: €32,613 million), primarily due to lower \\nsales volumes, lower energy prices, lower material costs – particu-\\nlarly in the first half of the year – and measures to reduce costs and \\nimprove productivity.

The figure for fiscal 2024 includes \\nmajor restructuring expenses. \\nIn the Automotive group sector, costs in connection with initial \\nproduct development projects in the original-equipment business \\nare capitalized. Costs are capitalized as at the time at which we are \\nnamed as a supplier and have successfully achieved a specific pre-\\nrelease stage. Capitalization ends with the approval for unlimited \\nvolume production. The costs of customer-specific applications, \\npre-production prototypes and testing for products already being \\nsold do not qualify as development expenditure that may be recog-\\nnized as an intangible asset. Capitalized development expenses are \\namortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of three to seven \\nyears and recognized in the cost of sales. In the opinion of the Con-\\ntinental Group, the assumed useful life reflects the period for which \\nan economic benefit is likely to be derived from the corresponding \\ndevelopment projects. Of the development costs incurred in 2024, \\nincluding development expenses for internally developed software, \\n€16 million (PY: €18 million) in the Automotive group sector qualified \\nfor recognition as an asset. \\nAs in the previous year, the requirements for the capitalization of \\ndevelopment activities were not met in the Tires, ContiTech or  \\nContract Manufacturing group sectors. \\nThis results in a capitalization ratio of 0.6% (PY: 0.6%) for the Conti-\\nnental Group. \\nDepreciation and amortization \\nDepreciation and amortization decreased by €14 million to €2,211 \\nmillion (PY: €2,225 million), equivalent to 5.6% of sales (PY: 5.4%). It \\nincluded impairment totaling €37 million in 2024 (PY: €57 million). \\nFinancial result \\nThe negative financial result increased by €163 million year-on-\\nyear to €398 million in 2024 (PY: €236 million), mainly due to the \\nsum of effects from currency translation, changes in the fair value \\nof derivative instruments and other valuation effects.  \\nOverall, interest income remained at the previous year’s level and \\namounted to €103 million.  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Economic Report \\n52\\n \\n \\nInterest expense totaled €449 million in 2024 and was thus €29 \\nmillion higher than the previous year’s figure of €419 million. Inter-\\nest expense from long-term employee benefits and expected in-\\ncome from long-term employee benefits and from pension funds \\namounted to a net expense of €90 million in the reporting year  \\n(PY: €85 million). These interest effects do not include the interest \\nincome from the plan assets of the pension contribution funds or \\nthe interest expense from the defined benefit obligations of the \\npension contribution funds. Interest expense, resulting mainly from \\nbank borrowings, capital market transactions and other financing \\ninstruments, was €359 million (PY: €335 million). Interest expense \\non lease liabilities accounted for €31 million of this (PY: €28 million). \\nThe bonds issued by Continental AG and Conti-Gummi Finance B.V., \\nMaastricht, Netherlands, resulted in expenses of €111 million (PY: \\n€97 million). Interest expense in connection with the utilization of \\nthe syndicated loan totaled €32 million (PY: €19 million). \\nEffects from currency translation resulted in a negative contribution \\nto earnings of €2 million in the reporting year (PY: positive contri-\\nbution to earnings of €79 million). Effects from changes in the fair \\nvalue of derivative instruments, and other valuation effects resulted \\nin expenses of €51 million (PY: income of €1 million). Other valuation \\neffects accounted for €15 million of this (PY: income of €1 million). \\nTaking into account the sum of the effects from currency translation \\nand changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, earnings in \\n2024 were negatively impacted by €37 million (PY: positively im-\\npacted by €79 million). This year-on-year trend was primarily at-\\ntributable to the development of the Chinese renminbi in relation  \\nto the euro. \\nIncome tax expense  \\nIncome tax expense in fiscal 2024 amounted to €689 million (PY: \\n€424 million). The tax rate was 36.5%, compared with 26.2% in the \\nprevious year.  \\nThe year under review was positively impacted by taxes for previ-\\nous years and – like in 2023 – foreign tax rate differences as well as \\nincentives and tax holidays. However, the tax rate was negatively \\nimpacted by non-cash allowances on deferred tax assets totaling \\n€311 million (PY: €64 million), of which €258 million (PY: €42 mil-\\nlion) was for previous years. Furthermore, as in the previous year, \\nthe tax rate was negatively affected by non-deductible expenses \\nand non-imputable foreign withholding taxes of €291 million (PY: \\n€191 million). The increase compared with the previous year is due, \\namong other things, to non-deductible operating expenses in con-\\nnection with dividend distributions from subsidiaries, which were \\nmade as a preparatory measure for the planned spin-off of the  \\nAutomotive and Contract Manufacturing group sectors. In the year \\nunder review, additional tax burdens were incurred from local in-\\ncome taxes with a different tax base and minimum tax regulations. \\nNet income attributable to the shareholders of the parent  \\nNet income attributable to the shareholders of the parent increased \\nby €11 million in 2024 to €1,168 million (PY: €1,156 million). Basic \\nearnings per share amounted to €5.84 (PY: €5.78), the same \\namount as diluted earnings per share. \\nEmployees \\nThe number of employees in the Continental Group as at Decem-\\nber 31, 2024, was 190,159, down 12,604 from 202,763 in the \\nprevious year.  \\nThe number of employees in the Automotive group sector decreased \\nby 9,832, mainly due to transformation projects and adjustments to \\norder volumes.  \\nThe number of employees in the Tires group sector increased by \\n711, primarily due to adjustments to demand-driven production.  \\nIn the ContiTech group sector, adjustments to production volumes \\nand the implementation of structural changes led to a reduction in \\nthe number of employees by 2,738.  \\nThe number of employees in the Contract Manufacturing group \\nsector fell by 706 to 772 (PY: 1,478). \\n \\nEmployees by region in % \\n2024 \\n2023 \\nGermany \\n21 \\n22 \\nEurope excluding Germany \\n35 \\n34 \\nNorth America \\n18 \\n19 \\nAsia-Pacific \\n21 \\n20 \\nOther countries \\n5 \\n4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Economic Report \\n53\\n \\nFinancial Position \\n› Free cash flow at €1.1 billion \\n› Cash outflow arising from investing activities at €1.8 billion \\n› Net indebtedness at €3.7 billion \\nReconciliation of cash flow  \\nAt €2,934 million in 2024, the cash inflow arising from operating \\nactivities was €393 million lower than the previous year’s figure \\n(PY: €3,328 million) and corresponded to 7.4% of sales (PY: 8.0%). \\nThe main reason for this was the payment of €476 million to buy \\nback shares in ContiTech AG (now operating under the name Conti-\\nTech Deutschland GmbH). The addition to plan assets in 2022, \\nwhich was netted with the associated obligations to employees in \\naccordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, was offset by a liability \\nthat was paid out in the first half of 2024 (for further details, please \\nrefer to Notes 29 and 34 to the consolidated financial statements \\nin the 2022 annual report). As changes in employee benefits are  \\nallocated to cash flow arising from operating activities in the state-\\nment of cash flows, the payment of the liability was also allocated \\nto cash flow arising from operating activities and presented in \\nchanges to other assets and liabilities and other non-cash effects. \\nCash inflow arising from operating activities was additionally im-\\npacted by payments for restructuring. The increase in EBIT of €433 \\nmillion to €2,287 million (PY: €1,854 million) coupled with the cash-\\neffective decline in working capital had an offsetting effect. \\nThe cash-effective decline in working capital led to a cash inflow  \\nof €223 million (PY: cash outflow of €264 million). This cash inflow \\nwas attributable to two factors: a decrease in inventories of €131 \\nmillion (PY: €378 million) and a reduction in operating receivables \\nof €460 million (PY: €51 million). These developments can be ex-\\nplained by the positive effects of working capital management and \\nthe overall downtrend in sales. The decrease in operating liabilities \\nof €368 million (PY: €693 million) had an offsetting effect.  \\nInterest payments increased by €67 million to €346 million (PY: \\n€279 million). Income tax payments rose by €59 million to €785 \\nmillion (PY: €725 million). \\nCash flow arising from investing activities amounted to an outflow \\nof €1,821 million (PY: €2,169 million). Capital expenditure on prop-\\nerty, plant and equipment, and software was down €187 million \\nfrom €2,124 million to €1,938 million before the capitalization of \\nborrowing costs and right-of-use assets from leases.  \\nThe net amount from the acquisition and disposal of companies \\nand business operations led to a cash inflow of €61 million in 2024 \\n(PY: cash outflow of €133 million). This cash inflow was mainly at-\\ntributable to the sale of some operations of the Autonomous Mobil-\\nity business area in the Automotive group sector.  \\nThese effects resulted in free cash flow of €1,114 million (PY: €1,159 \\nmillion) for fiscal 2024, corresponding to a year-on-year decrease \\nof €45 million. \\nCapital expenditure (additions)  \\nCapital expenditure for property, plant and equipment, and software \\namounted to €2,204 million in 2024 (PY: €2,437 million). The Au-\\ntomotive group sector in particular contributed to the decrease of \\n€233 million. The capital expenditure ratio was 5.5% (PY: 5.9%). \\nFinancing and indebtedness \\nGross indebtedness amounted to €6,909 million as at the end of \\n2024 (PY: €7,170 million), down €261 million on the previous \\nyear’s level.  \\nBased on quarter-end values, 68.5% (PY: 74.4%) of gross indebted-\\nness after hedging measures had fixed interest rates on average \\nover the year. \\nThe carrying amount of the bonds decreased negligibly from \\n€3,969 million in the previous year to €3,861 million as at the end \\nof fiscal 2024. Under the Debt Issuance Programme (DIP), Conti-\\nnental AG issued one listed euro bond on October 1, 2024, with an \\nissue volume of €600 million. The issue price of this bond, which \\nhas a term of five years and a fixed interest rate of 3.500% p.a., was \\n99.946%. The €625-million euro bond of Conti-Gummi Finance B.V., \\nMaastricht, Netherlands, maturing on September 25, 2024, was re-\\ndeemed in the second half of the year at a rate of 100.000%. This \\nbond had an interest rate of 1.125% p.a. and a term of four years \\nand three months. In addition, on October 16, 2024, the private \\nplacement issued by Continental AG in October 2019 was redeemed \\nat a rate of 100.000%. The private placement had a nominal vol-\\nume of €100 million, a term of five years and a fixed interest rate  \\nof 0.231% p.a. \\nBank loans and overdrafts amounted to €1,042 million (PY: €1,386 \\nmillion) as at December 31, 2024, and were therefore €343 million \\nbelow the previous year’s level. \\nThe syndicated loan that was renewed ahead of schedule in De-\\ncember 2019 consists of a revolving tranche of €4,000 million and \\nhas an original term of five years. The margin will also depend on \\nthe Continental Group’s sustainability performance. If the Continen-\\ntal Group achieves the performance improvements in sustainability \\nas set out in detail in the loan agreement, this will reduce the mar-\\ngin; non-achievement will result in a margin increase. Continental \\nhas exercised two options, each extending the term of the loan by \\none year. This means that the financing commitment of the banks \\nis now available until December 2026. This revolving loan had not \\nbeen utilized as at December 31, 2024 (PY: €316 million utilized by \\nContinental Rubber of America, Corp., Wilmington, Delaware, USA).  \\nOther indebtedness increased by €190 million to €2,005 million \\n(PY: €1,815 million) as at the end of 2024, primarily attributable to \\na higher issue volume of commercial paper. This resulted in liabili-\\nties totaling €335 million (PY: €16 million). As at the end of 2024, \\nthe utilization of sale-of-receivables programs was down slightly on \\nthe previous year at €299 million (PY: €321 million).

\\nThe Automotive group sector (49% of consolidated sales) offers \\ntechnologies for safety, brake, chassis, motion and motion-control \\nsystems. Its portfolio also includes innovative solutions for assisted \\nand automated driving, display and operating technologies, camera \\nsolutions for the vehicle interior as well as intelligent information \\nand communication technology associated with the mobility ser-\\nvices of fleet operators and commercial vehicle manufacturers. \\nComprehensive activities relating to vehicle connectivity, architec-\\nture and electronics, as well as high-performance computers and \\nsoftware solutions, round off the range of products and services. \\nSince November 1, 2024, the group sector has been divided into \\nfour business areas: \\n› Architecture and Network Solutions (formerly Architecture and \\nNetworking) \\n› Autonomous Mobility \\n› Safety and Motion \\n› User Experience \\nThe former Software and Central Technologies business area was \\ndiscontinued effective November 1, 2024, and has since been \\nincluded in the Automotive group sector.  \\n \\nBusiness and sales performance \\nSales volumes in the Automotive group sector were hampered by \\nthe challenging market environment, with declining vehicle produc-\\ntion in Europe having a major impact on demand. In the Safety and \\nMotion business area, sales figures for brake systems and airbag \\ncontrol units decreased, while those for wheel sensors remained \\nstable. In the Architecture and Network Solutions business area as \\nwell as the Autonomous Mobility business area, sales volumes were \\nup year-on-year for connectivity technologies, high-performance \\ncomputers and products for the commercial vehicle sector. In the \\nUser Experience business area, sales figures for display solutions \\nsaw a significant decline, due in particular to lower installation rates \\nand delays in new product launches. \\n \\n \\nDevelopment of the Group Sectors \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Economic Report \\n60\\n \\n \\nOffsetting the volume-related sales reduction, price adjustments \\nagreed with customers to compensate for the effects of inflation \\nhad a positive impact on sales. Sales decreased by 4.3% year-on-\\nyear to €19,416 million (PY: €20,295 million). Before changes in \\nthe scope of consolidation and exchange-rate effects, sales de-\\nclined by 2.6%. \\n \\nAdjusted EBIT  \\nAdjusted EBIT for the Automotive group sector increased by €53 \\nmillion or 13.2% year-on-year in 2024 to €454 million (PY: €401 \\nmillion), corresponding to 2.3% (PY: 2.0%) of adjusted sales. \\nEBIT \\nThe Automotive group sector reported a year-on-year increase in \\nEBIT of €286 million or 498.5% to €229 million in 2024 (PY: -€57 \\nmillion). The return on sales rose accordingly to 1.2% (PY: -0.3%). \\nThe cost of sales fell by €848 million to €15,928 million (PY: \\n€16,776 million), primarily due to lower sales volumes, normalizing \\npurchase prices for raw materials, measures to reduce costs and \\nimprovements to efficiency. EBIT in the previous year was heavily \\nencumbered by restructuring expenses. \\nThe amortization of intangible assets from purchase price alloca-\\ntion (PPA) reduced EBIT by €55 million (PY: €58 million). \\nFor the Automotive group sector, total consolidated expense from \\nspecial effects in 2024 amounted to €170 million (PY: €387 million). \\nFor further details, please see our comments on pages 48 and 49 \\nregarding the special effects in 2024 and 2023. \\nThe ROCE was 2.6% (PY: -0.6%). \\nProcurement  \\nElectronic components and semiconductors are essential semi- \\nfinished products for the Automotive group sector. In this procure-\\nment segment in particular, availability improved significantly in \\n2024 compared with the previous year. Manufacturers ensured \\nthat sufficient capacity was available for producing semiconduc-\\ntors, taking into account multiple-month lead times. The capacity \\nsituation was eased further by weak demand for semiconductors in \\nthe industry, declining vehicle production in the automotive sector \\nand inventory adjustments in the automotive supply chain. This \\nwas contrasted by growing demand for specific components, in-\\ncluding for data centers specializing in generative artificial intelli-\\ngence (GenAI), especially in the USA and Asia. \\nPrices for some semiconductors fell year-on-year in 2024. However, \\ntrends were varied: multisource components recorded sharp price \\ndeclines, while semiconductors used in the automotive industry \\nand GenAI, for example, remained in scarce supply and saw prices \\nclimb. Continental is in negotiations with suppliers to safeguard in-\\nventories.  \\nSteel, aluminum, copper and plastics, which are important raw  \\nmaterials for the Automotive group sector, were exposed over the \\ncourse of the year to a challenging geopolitical environment that \\nwas influenced by trade and sanctions barriers. Nevertheless, prices \\nand freight rates remained largely stable over the year as a whole. \\nThe expected economic recovery in China at the beginning of the \\nyear was slowed down by the ongoing real estate crisis. This led to \\nhigher steel exports to other regions, which in turn put global steel \\nprices under pressure. The trade embargoes imposed by the USA \\nand the UK for Russian aluminum, copper and nickel on the COMEX \\nand LME metal exchanges in April sent prices soaring, although \\nthis spike ultimately proved to be short-lived due to low demand.  \\nIn the fourth quarter, aluminum prices rose significantly compared \\nwith the prices for other materials due to supply shortages for the \\ninput material bauxite.  \\nResearch and development \\nResearch and development expenses (net) decreased by €28 mil-\\nlion or 1.2% year-on-year to €2,356 million (PY: €2,385 million), \\ncorresponding to 12.1% (PY: 11.8%) of sales. The figure for fiscal \\n2024 includes major restructuring expenses. \\nDepreciation and amortization \\nDepreciation and amortization increased by €55 million compared \\nwith fiscal 2023 to €1,094 million (PY: €1,039 million) and amounted \\nto 5.6% of sales (PY: 5.1%). It included impairment totaling €30 mil-\\nlion in 2024 (PY: €13 million). \\nOperating assets  \\nOperating assets in the Automotive group sector decreased by \\n€241 million year-on-year to €8,603 million (PY: €8,844 million)  \\nas at December 31, 2024. \\nWorking capital was up €7 million at €2,620 million (PY: €2,612 \\nmillion). Inventories decreased by €265 million to €2,560 million \\n(PY: €2,825 million). Operating receivables fell by €145 million to \\n€3,666 million (PY: €3,811 million) as at the reporting date. Operat-\\ning liabilities were down €417 million at €3,607 million (PY: €4,024 \\nmillion). \\nNon-current operating assets were down €293 million at €8,161 \\nmillion (PY: €8,453 million). Goodwill fell by €31 million to €2,129 \\nmillion (PY: €2,160 million), driven mainly by disposals from the \\nscope of consolidation in the amount of €41 million and offset in \\nturn by exchange-rate effects in the amount of €10 million. At \\n€5,249 million, property, plant and equipment were €139 million \\nbelow the previous year’s level of €5,388 million. Other intangible \\nassets fell by €144 million to €418 million (PY: €562 million). Amor-\\ntization of intangible assets from purchase price allocation (PPA) in \\nthe amount of €55 million (PY: €58 million) reduced the value of in-\\ntangible assets. \\n20,295\\n19,416\\n2023\\n2024\\nSales\\n€ millions\\n2024\\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Economic Report \\n61\\n \\nIn the Automotive group sector, operating assets declined by \\n€91 million due to the sale of certain operations in the Autono-\\nmous Mobility business area.

While the Continental Group’s consolidated sales of €39.7 \\nbillion were €1.7 billion below the previous year’s figure of €41.4 \\nbillion, the adjusted EBIT margin improved to 6.8% (PY: 6.1%) on \\nthe back of lower energy prices and, in the first half of the year in \\nparticular, lower material costs, but above all the implementation  \\nof cost reduction measures and efficiency improvements. Adjusted \\nfree cash flow was €1,052 million (PY: €1,292 million), slightly above \\nthe target range. The payment for the buyback of shares in Conti-\\nTech AG (now operating under the name ContiTech Deutschland \\nGmbH) and payments for restructuring had a negative impact on \\nadjusted free cash flow, while the improved operating result and \\npositive effects of working capital management had an offsetting \\neffect.   \\nFaced with a continued challenging market environment and de-\\nclining vehicle production, especially in Europe, the Automotive \\ngroup sector recorded a drop in sales of €0.9 billion to €19.4 billion \\n(PY: €20.3 billion). At the same time, Automotive increased its ad-\\njusted EBIT margin to 2.3% (PY: 2.0%) and significantly improved its \\nEBIT. This improvement was primarily attributable to the rigorous \\nimplementation of cost reduction measures, efficiency improve-\\nments and agreements from price negotiations with automotive \\nmanufacturers. In addition, the prior-year figure was heavily encum-\\nbered by restructuring expenses. \\nSales in the Tires group sector contracted slightly to €13.9 billion \\n(PY: €14.0 billion) on the back of negative exchange-rate effects \\nand weak demand in the passenger-car original-equipment busi-\\nness, but were propped up by growth in the global tire-replacement \\nmarkets. Nevertheless, Tires managed to slightly increase its ad-\\njusted EBIT margin from 13.5% in the previous year to 13.7% in \\n2024, mainly on the back of the growing share of premium tires \\nand a strong winter tire business in Europe. \\nThe downtrend in the automotive original-equipment business in \\nEurope and North America combined with persistently weak mar-\\nkets, particularly in the industrial segment, likewise depressed sales \\nin ContiTech, with the group sector recording sales of €6.4 billion \\n(PY: €6.8 billion).

The management report of Continental AG has \\nbeen combined with the consolidated report of the Continental \\nGroup in accordance with Section 315 (5) HGB, as the parent com-\\npany’s future risks and opportunities and its expected development \\nare inextricably linked to that of the Continental Group as a whole. \\nIn addition, the following presentation of the parent company’s \\nbusiness performance, including its results, net assets and financial \\nposition, provides a basis for understanding the Executive Board’s \\nproposal for the distribution of retained earnings. \\nContinental AG acts solely as a management and holding company \\nfor the Continental Group. \\nTotal assets increased by €2,239 million year-on-year to €23,250 \\nmillion (PY: €21,011 million). On the assets side, the change re-\\nsulted primarily from the increase in receivables from affiliated \\ncompanies of €2,403 million to €11,300 million (PY: €8,897 mil-\\nlion). This was offset by cash and cash equivalents, which fell by \\n€209 million to €164 million (PY: €372 million). \\nInvestments rose by €3 million year-on-year to €11,378 million  \\n(PY: €11,375 million), thus corresponding to 48.9% of total assets \\n(PY: 54.1%).  \\nProperty, plant and equipment fell by €2 million year-on-year to \\n€261 million (PY: €264 million).  \\nAt €120 million (PY: €82 million), prepaid expenses and deferred \\ncharges were up €38 million. This increase resulted mainly from \\nhigher year-on-year accruals for IT services. \\n \\nNet assets and financial position of Continental AG \\nDec. 31, 2024 \\nDec. 31, 2023 \\nAssets in € millions \\n  \\n  \\nIntangible assets \\n7 \\n10 \\nProperty, plant and equipment \\n261 \\n264 \\nInvestments \\n11,378 \\n11,375 \\nNon-current assets \\n11,647 \\n11,649 \\nReceivables and other assets \\n11,320 \\n8,908 \\nCash and cash equivalents \\n164 \\n372 \\nCurrent assets \\n11,483 \\n9,280 \\nPrepaid expenses and deferred charges \\n120 \\n82 \\nTotal assets \\n23,250 \\n21,011 \\n \\n  \\n  \\nShareholders’ equity and liabilities in € millions \\n  \\n  \\nSubscribed capital \\n512 \\n512 \\nCapital reserves \\n4,179 \\n4,179 \\nRevenue reserves \\n3,401 \\n55 \\nRetained earnings \\n5,317 \\n2,412 \\nShareholders’ equity \\n13,409 \\n7,157 \\nProvisions \\n616 \\n881 \\nLiabilities \\n9,224 \\n12,973 \\nTotal equity and liabilities \\n23,250 \\n21,011 \\n \\n  \\n  \\nEquity ratio in % \\n57.7 \\n34.1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG – Short Version in Accordance \\nwith HGB \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Continental AG – Short Version in Accordance with HGB \\n71\\nOn the equity and liabilities side, the change resulted primarily from \\nthe increase in shareholders’ equity of €6,252 million to €13,409 \\nmillion (PY: €7,157 million) and the increase in bonds of €824 mil-\\nlion to €4,183 million (PY: €3,359 million). This was partially offset \\nby the decline in liabilities to affiliated companies of €4,345 million \\nto €4,208 million (PY: €8,553 million). \\nThe increase in bonds was partially due to the issuance of a new \\neuro bond in October 2024 with a total nominal volume of €600 \\nmillion. Furthermore, as at the reporting date, Continental AG had \\nissued commercial paper with a total volume of €309 million. An \\noffsetting effect was attributable to the on-time repayment of a  \\nprivate placement on October 16, 2024, with a nominal volume  \\nof €100 million. \\nBank loans and overdrafts rose by €145 million to €710 million \\n(PY: €565 million). \\nLiabilities to affiliated companies were down €4,345 million year-\\non-year to €4,208 million (PY: €8,553 million). This was primarily at-\\ntributable to the reduced provision of loans and overnight deposits \\nmade available to Continental AG by its subsidiaries. \\nOther liabilities fell by €372 million year-on-year to €21 million (PY: \\n€393 million). Of this decline, €364 million was attributable to the \\npayment in January 2024 of the purchase price for the reacquisi-\\ntion of shares in ContiTech AG (now operating under the name \\nContiTech Deutschland GmbH) to Continental Pension Trust e.V. \\nProvisions decreased by €264 million year-on-year to €616 million \\n(PY: €881 million) due to the €104 million decline in other provisions \\nto €87 million (PY: €191 million), the €99 million decline in pension \\nprovisions to €285 million (PY: €384 million) and the €62 million  \\ndecline in tax provisions to €244 million (PY: €306 million).  \\nOf the decline in pension provisions, €99 million was also due in \\nlarge part to the reacquisition of shares in ContiTech AG (now oper-\\nating under the name ContiTech Deutschland GmbH). This led to a \\n€111 million rise in plan assets. The reimbursement of pensions \\nfrom the trust assets of Continental Pension Trust e.V. paid out by \\nContinental AG in fiscal 2023 and 2024 had an offsetting effect,  \\nreducing plan assets by €22 million. \\nShareholders’ equity rose by €6,252 million to €13,409 million (PY: \\n€7,157 million), driven by net income of €6,692 million in the fiscal \\nyear. An offsetting effect was attributable to the dividend distribu-\\ntion of €440 million carried out in fiscal 2024. The equity ratio rose \\nfrom 34.1% in the prior year to 57.7%. \\nSales for fiscal 2024 climbed by €59 million to €396 million (PY: \\n€337 million), primarily due to higher sales from corporate services. \\nOther operating income increased by €219 million year-on-year to \\n€321 million (PY: €102 million). This was primarily attributable to \\nthe transfer of expenses to group subsidiaries according to the in-\\nput involved. These expenses were incurred by Continental AG \\nfrom the proceedings conducted by the prosecutor’s offices in \\nFrankfurt am Main and Hanover due to illegal defeat devices in die-\\nsel engines in previous years. In line with the transfer of expenses, \\nthe provision was reversed in the amount of the fines arising from \\nthe proceedings conducted by the public prosecutor’s office in \\nHanover attributable to other subsidiaries. The costs of the pro-\\nceedings incurred in fiscal 2024 were distributed proportionately, \\nand in accordance with the fine notice amounts, between the sub-\\nsidiaries responsible. The provision recognized for this by Continen-\\ntal AG was reversed in the corresponding amount. \\nNet investment income rose by €6,992 million year-on-year to \\n€7,043 million (PY: €51 million). As in the previous year, it mainly \\nconsisted of profit and loss transfers from the subsidiaries. Income \\nfrom profit transfers of €7,043 million (PY: €767 million) resulted in \\nparticular from Continental Caoutchouc-Export-GmbH, Hanover \\n(€6,915 million) and from Continental Automotive GmbH, Hanover \\n(€110 million). The increase in profit transfer is mainly due to pre-\\nparatory measures for the planned spin-off of the Automotive and \\nContract Manufacturing group sectors. No expenses from loss \\ntransfers were recorded in the fiscal year (PY: €719 million). \\nThe negative net interest result increased by €65 million year-on-\\nyear to €293 million in fiscal 2024 (PY: €229 million), primarily at-\\ntributable to higher borrowing costs on average than in fiscal 2023. \\nInterest expense rose by €95 million in the fiscal year to €457 mil-\\nlion (PY: €362 million), with interest expenses to affiliated companies \\nincreasing by €85 million to €293 million (PY: €208 million). Fur-\\nthermore, the euro bonds issued by Continental AG led to expenses \\nof €104 million (PY: €75 million). The €29 million increase resulted \\nprimarily from the euro bond issued in October 2024 with a nomi-\\nnal volume of €600 million and a fixed interest rate of 3.500% p.a. \\nInterest income rose by €30 million in the fiscal year to €164 mil-\\nlion (PY: €134 million). This was primarily due to interest income \\nfrom affiliated companies.  \\nThe tax expense of €29 million (PY: €23 million) resulted mainly \\nfrom non-imputable withholding taxes for the income tax consoli-\\ndation group of Continental AG as well as the reversal of tax-related \\nrisks, a provision for tax-related risks arising from the company au-\\ndit conducted by a foreign tax authority and first-time tax expenses \\nof €9 million from the global minimum corporate tax rate. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Continental AG – Short Version in Accordance with HGB \\n72\\nAfter taking income tax expense into account, Continental AG gen-\\nerated net income for the year of €6,692 million (PY: net loss of \\n€423 million). The after-tax return on equity was 49.9% (PY: -5.9%). \\nContinental AG has defined a target range for dividend distribution \\nof 20% to 40% of net income attributable to the shareholders. Of \\nthe net income for fiscal 2024, €3,346 million was allocated to \\nother revenue reserves. Taking into account the retained earnings \\nbrought forward from the previous year of €2,412 million and the \\ndividend distribution of €440 million, as well as the allocation of \\n€3,346 million to revenue reserves, retained earnings amounted  \\nto €5,317 million. The Supervisory Board and Executive Board will \\npropose to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting the payment of a divi-\\ndend of €2.50 per share entitled to dividends. The total distribution \\nis therefore €500,014,957.50 for 200,005,983 shares entitled to \\ndividends. The remaining retained earnings are to be allocated in \\nthe amount of €4,817 million to other revenue reserves. \\nWe expect further income from profit and loss transfers and invest-\\nment income from the subsidiaries within the scope of the holding \\nactivities of Continental AG in fiscal 2025. Furthermore, Continental \\nAG will continue to provide a financing function for its subsidiaries. \\n \\nEarnings position of Continental AG in € millions \\n2024 \\n2023 \\nSales \\n396 \\n337 \\nCost of sales \\n–381 \\n–326 \\nGross margin on sales \\n15 \\n11 \\nAdministrative expenses \\n–272 \\n–213 \\nOther operating income \\n321 \\n102 \\nOther operating expenses \\n–94 \\n–125 \\nNet investment income \\n7,043 \\n51 \\nIncome from other securities and long-term loans \\n2 \\n1 \\nNet interest result \\n–293 \\n–229 \\nResult from activities \\n6,721 \\n–401 \\nIncome tax expense \\n–29 \\n–23 \\nNet income \\n6,692 \\n–423 \\nAccumulated profits brought forward from the previous year \\n1,972 \\n2,835 \\nAllocation to other revenue reserves \\n–3,346 \\n— \\nRetained earnings \\n5,317 \\n2,412 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Other Information \\n73\\nFinal declaration from the Executive Board’s report on \\nrelations with affiliated companies pursuant to Section 312  \\nof the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG) \\nIn fiscal 2024, Continental AG was a dependent company of INA-\\nHolding Schaeffler GmbH & Co. KG, Herzogenaurach, Germany, as \\ndefined under Section 312 AktG. In line with Section 312 (1) AktG, \\nthe Executive Board of Continental AG has prepared a report on re-\\nlations with affiliated companies, which contains the following final \\ndeclaration: \\n \\n“We declare that the company received an appropriate considera-\\ntion for each transaction and measure listed in the report on rela-\\ntions with affiliated companies from January 1 to December 31, \\n2024, under the circumstances known to us at the time the trans-\\nactions were made or the measures taken or not taken. To the ex-\\ntent the company suffered any detriment thereby, the company \\nwas granted the right to an appropriate compensation before the \\nend of the 2024 fiscal year. The company did not suffer any detri-\\nment because of taking or refraining from measures.”\\nAdditional Disclosures and Notes Pursuant to \\nSections 289a and 315a HGB \\n1. Composition of issued capital \\nAs of the end of the reporting period, the issued capital of the  \\ncompany amounted to €512,015,316.48 and is divided into \\n200,005,983 no-par-value shares. These shares of Continental AG \\nare, without exception, common shares; different classes of shares \\nhave not been issued and have not been provided for in the Arti-\\ncles of Incorporation. Each share bears voting and dividend rights \\nfrom the time it is issued. Each share entitles the holder to one vote \\nat a Shareholders’ Meeting (Article 20 (1) of the Articles of Incorpo-\\nration). There are no shares with privileges. \\n2. Restrictions on voting rights or transfer options \\nRestrictions relating to voting rights or the transfer of the company’s \\nshares are not known to the Executive Board. \\n3. Shareholdings exceeding 10% of voting rights \\nFor details of the equity interests exceeding 10% of the voting rights \\n(reported level of equity interest), please refer to the notice in ac-\\ncordance with the German Securities Trading Act (Wertpapier- \\nhandelsgesetz – WpHG) under Note 42 to the consolidated finan-\\ncial statements, and to the notes to the separate financial state-\\nments of Continental AG. \\n4. Bearers of shares with privileges \\nThere are no shares with privileges granting control. \\n5. Type of voting right control for employee shareholdings  \\nThe company is not aware of any employees with shareholdings \\nnot directly exercising control of their voting rights. \\n6. Provisions for the appointment and dismissal of members \\nof the Executive Board and for the amendment of the \\nArticles of Incorporation \\na) In accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, the Executive \\nBoard consists of at least two members; beyond this the num-\\nber of members of the Executive Board is determined by the \\nSupervisory Board. Members of the Executive Board are ap-\\npointed and dismissed in accordance with Section 84 of the \\nGerman Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG) in con-\\njunction with Section 31 of the German Co-determination Act \\n(Mitbestimmungsgesetz – MitbestG). In line with this, the  \\nSupervisory Board is responsible for the appointment and dis-\\nmissal of members of the Executive Board. It passes decisions \\nwith a majority of two-thirds of its members. If this majority is \\nnot reached in the event of an appointment, the so-called Me-\\ndiation Committee must submit a nomination to the Supervi-\\nsory Board for the appointment within one month of voting. \\nOther nominations can also be submitted to the Supervisory \\nBoard in addition to the Mediation Committee’s nomination. A \\nsimple majority of the votes is sufficient when voting on these \\nnominations submitted to the Supervisory Board. In the event \\nthat voting results in a tie, a new vote takes place in which the \\nchairman of the Supervisory Board has the casting vote in ac-\\ncordance with Section 31 (4) MitbestG. \\nb) Amendments to the Articles of Incorporation are made by the \\nShareholders’ Meeting. In Article 20 (3) of the Articles of In-\\ncorporation, the Shareholders’ Meeting has exercised the op-\\ntion granted in Section 179 (1) Sentence 2 AktG to confer on \\nthe Supervisory Board the power to make amendments af-\\nfecting only the wording of the Articles of Incorporation. \\nIn accordance with Article 20 (2) of the Articles of Incorpora-\\ntion, resolutions of the Shareholders’ Meeting to amend the \\nArticles of Incorporation are usually adopted by a simple ma-\\njority and, insofar as a capital majority is required, by a simple \\nmajority of the capital represented unless otherwise stipu-\\nlated by mandatory law or particular provisions of the Articles \\nof Incorporation. The law prescribes a mandatory majority of \\nthree-quarters of the share capital represented when resolu-\\ntions are made, for example, for amendments to the Articles \\nof Incorporation involving substantial capital measures, such \\nas resolutions concerning the creation of authorized or con-\\ntingent capital. \\n7. Authorizations of the Executive Board, particularly with \\nregard to its options for issuing or withdrawing shares \\na) The Executive Board can issue new shares only on the basis \\nof resolutions by the Shareholders’ Meeting. As at the end of \\nthe reporting period, the Executive Board had not been  \\nOther Information  \\nDependent Company Report \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Other Information \\n74\\nauthorized to issue new shares in connection with a capital \\nincrease (authorized capital) or to issue convertible bonds, \\nwarrant-linked bonds or other financial instruments that \\ncould entitle the bearers to subscribe to new shares. \\nb) The Executive Board may only buy back shares under the \\nconditions codified in Section 71 AktG. The Shareholders’ \\nMeeting has not authorized the Executive Board to acquire \\ntreasury shares in line with Section 71 (1) No. 8 AktG. \\n8. Material agreements of the company subject to a change of \\ncontrol following a takeover bid and their consequences \\nThe following material agreements are subject to a change of con-\\ntrol at Continental AG: \\na) The agreement concluded on December 3, 2019, for a syn-\\ndicated revolving credit facility of €4.0 billion grants each \\ncreditor the right to terminate the agreement prematurely \\nand to demand repayment of the loans granted by it if one \\nperson or several persons acting in concert acquire control \\nof Continental AG and subsequent negotiations concerning \\na continuation of the loan do not lead to an agreement. The \\nterm “control” is defined as the holding of more than 50% of \\nthe voting rights or if Continental AG concludes a domina-\\ntion agreement as defined under Section 291 AktG with \\nContinental AG as the company dominated.  \\nb) The bonds issued by Continental AG in September 2019 at a \\nnominal amount of €600 million, in May 2020 at a nominal \\namount of €750 million, in November 2022 at a nominal \\namount of €625 million, in June 2023 at a nominal amount \\nof €750 million, in August 2023 at a nominal amount of \\n€500 million and in October 2024 at a nominal amount of \\n€600 million entitle each bondholder to demand that the \\nbonds held by the bondholder be redeemed or acquired at  \\na price established in the bond conditions in the event of a \\nchange of control at Continental AG. The bond conditions \\ndefine a change of control as the sale of all or substantially \\nall of the company’s assets to third parties that are not affili-\\nated with the company, or as one person or several persons \\nacting in concert, pursuant to Section 2 (5) of the German \\nTakeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz – \\nWpÜG), holding more than 50% of the voting rights in Conti-\\nnental AG by means of acquisition or as a result of a merger \\nor other form of combination with the participation of Conti-\\nnental AG. \\nIf a change of control occurs as described in the agreements \\nabove and a contractual partner or bondholder exercises its \\nrespective rights, it is possible that required follow-up financing \\nmay not be approved under the existing conditions, which \\ncould therefore lead to higher financing costs. \\nc) In 1996, Compagnie Financière Michelin SCmA, Granges-\\nPaccot, Switzerland (now Compagnie Financière Michelin \\nSAS, Clermont-Ferrand, France), and Continental AG founded \\nMC Projects B.V., Maastricht, Netherlands, with each owning \\n50%. Michelin contributed the rights to the Uniroyal brand \\nfor Europe to the company. MC Projects B.V. licenses these \\nrights to Continental. According to the agreements, this li-\\ncense can be terminated without notice if a major competi-\\ntor in the tire business acquires more than 50% of the voting \\nrights of Continental. In this case, Michelin also has the right \\nto acquire a majority in MC Projects B.V. and to have MC Pro-\\njects B.V. increase its minority stake in the manufacturing \\ncompany of Continental Barum s.r.o., Otrokovice, Czech Re-\\npublic, to 51%. In the case of such a change of control and \\nthe exercise of these rights, there could be losses in sales  \\nof the Tires group sector and a reduction in the production \\ncapacity available to this group sector. \\n9. Compensation agreements of the company with members \\nof the Executive Board or employees in the event of a \\ntakeover bid \\nNo compensation agreements have been concluded between the \\ncompany and the members of the Executive Board or employees \\nproviding in the event of a takeover bid. \\nRemuneration of the Executive Board \\nThe total remuneration of the members of the Executive Board \\ncomprises a number of remuneration components. These include a \\nremuneration component that is unrelated to performance, includ-\\ning specific additional benefits and entitlement to a company pen-\\nsion, and a variable component that is based on performance, con-\\nsisting of a short-term remuneration component and long-term re-\\nmuneration components. Further details including individual remu-\\nneration are specified in the remuneration report that is available \\non our website  under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive \\nBoard.  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Other Information \\n75\\nThe corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB) \\nis available to our shareholders on our website  under Company/Corporate Governance/Principles and Declarations. Please also refer to \\nthe corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB starting on page 16 of this annual report. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCorporate Governance Statement  \\nPursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n76\\nThe overall situation is analyzed and \\nmanaged corporate-wide using the risk and \\nopportunity management system. \\nAs an integral part of the corporate strategy, Continental’s risk strat-\\negy is aligned with the company’s strategic objectives. It aims to \\ncreate long-term value while also taking into account the differenti-\\nation between the individual group sectors. We evaluate risks and \\nopportunities continually and responsibly to achieve our goal of \\nadding value. \\nWe define risk as the possibility of internal or external events occur-\\nring that can have a negative influence on the attainment of our \\nstrategic and operational targets. As a global corporation, Continen-\\ntal is exposed to a number of different risks that could impair busi-\\nness and, in extreme cases, threaten the company’s existence. At \\nthe same time, we aim to resolutely seize opportunities that arise, \\nas described in the Strategy of the Continental Group section. We \\naccept manageable risks if the resulting opportunities are expected \\nto result in sustainable growth in value. We consider growth in \\nvalue in terms of the Continental Value Contribution (CVC) system \\ndescribed in the Corporate Management section. \\nContinental’s Internal Control and  \\nRisk Management System \\nThe governance systems at Continental comprise the internal con-\\ntrol system (ICS), the risk management system (RMS) and – as a \\nsubcomponent of these systems – the compliance management \\nsystem (CMS). The risk management system in turn also includes \\nthe early risk identification system in accordance with Section 91 \\n(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG).  \\nThe Executive Board is responsible for the governance systems, \\nwhich include all subsidiaries under the control of Continental. The \\nSupervisory Board and its Audit Committee monitor the effective-\\nness of these systems. \\nMain characteristics of the internal control system \\nIn order to operate successfully as a company in a complex busi-\\nness environment and to ensure the effectiveness, efficiency and \\npropriety of all processes and compliance with the relevant legal \\nand sub-legislative regulations, Continental has established an inter-\\nnal control system that encompasses all relevant business pro-\\ncesses. Certain aspects of sustainability are also considered and \\ncontinuously further developed in compliance with the regulatory \\nframework. Further progress was made in the reporting year on in-\\ncorporating management and monitoring of the internal control \\nsystem into a holistic ICS governance system. \\nThe Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) Committee, chaired \\nby the Executive Board member responsible for Finance, Integrity \\nand Law, is responsible for monitoring the ICS and the RMS and – \\nas part of these systems – the CMS.  \\nKey elements of the corporate-wide ICS are the clear allocation of \\nresponsibilities and system-inherent controls in the respective pro-\\ncess flows. The two-person rule and separation of functions are fun-\\ndamental principles of this organization. Continental’s management \\nalso issues guidelines to ensure that all business processes are con-\\nducted in an economical, orderly and legally compliant manner. \\nGuidelines specific to the Continental Group and to its individual \\ngroup sectors are managed centrally in the “House of Rules” and \\nare thus available to all Continental employees. \\nBased on these fundamental principles and the globally applicable \\nguidelines, the ICS at Continental follows the Three Lines Model.  \\nIn the first line, system-inherent controls are configured in all func-\\ntional areas relevant to the organization to support the economical, \\norderly and legally compliant execution of process flow transactions \\nin accordance with the corporate-wide guidelines. At the same time, \\nthese transactional controls help to identify risks and deviations \\nthat require separate consideration. As the controls and process \\nflows established in the first line apply to Continental’s operating \\nbusiness, they are generally put in place at the level of our operating \\nunits, such as our subsidiaries, business areas and group sectors. \\nIn the second line of our ICS, guidelines for process flows are de-\\nveloped, implemented and updated and compliance with controls \\nand guidelines is monitored. Responsibility for this lies primarily \\nwith the group functions, in addition to the business areas and \\ngroup sectors. The responsibilities include, for example, the RMS \\nand the CMS. In order to perform this supervisory and monitoring \\nfunction, an integrated reporting system has been established that \\nincludes, for example, the financial reporting ICS, the general risk \\nmanagement system, the compliance risk management system \\nand the tax compliance management system. During the course of \\nthe progress made on formalizing the governance systems and the \\ncontinuous improvements made to processes, the ICS and the RMS \\nwere further developed and standardized in various projects. The \\nsupervisory and monitoring function is performed on the basis of \\nregular reports and supplemented as needed with effectiveness \\ntests as part of self-audits and regular internal and external reviews. \\nThe CMS plays an important role within the second line of defense \\nby helping to prevent, detect and respond to compliance violations. \\nThe Group Compliance group function is responsible for the CMS. \\nThe chief compliance officer reports directly to the Executive Board \\nReport on Risks and Opportunities  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n77\\nmember responsible for Finance, Integrity and Law. The work done \\nby Group Compliance focuses mainly on preventing and detecting \\ncorruption, fraud and other property offenses, violations of antitrust \\nand competition law and money laundering; implementing data \\nprotection; and responding to compliance violations. For other legal \\nareas in which there is a risk of compliance violations – such as taxes, \\ncustoms, sanctions and export controls, and quality/technical com-\\npliance – responsibility for appropriate and effective compliance \\nmanagement lies with the respective functions, which are supported \\nin these tasks by Group Compliance.  \\nAn effective culture of compliance is the basis for prevention. It be-\\ngins with setting an appropriate “tone from the top” by the Executive \\nBoard and management and, in addition to risk analysis, includes in \\nparticular employee training, compliance consulting and the inter-\\nnal publication of guidelines. \\nIn the course of risk analysis, the business activities of Continental \\nare examined for compliance risks within the scope of top-down as \\nwell as bottom-up review processes. The risk of compliance viola-\\ntions arises primarily from organizational structures and workflows, \\nthe given market situation, activities in certain geographical re-\\ngions, inappropriate incentive systems, conflicts of interest, and \\ncriminal intent on the part of individual employees. Furthermore, \\nfindings from investigations by the Group Internal Audit group \\nfunction as well as discussions with management and employees \\nat all hierarchical levels are taken into account. This risk analysis is \\nnot a one-off procedure, but is performed regularly and continu-\\nously updated. \\nPrevention is also fostered by consultation on specific matters with \\nGroup Compliance and by the internal publication of guidelines on \\ntopics such as anti-corruption (including giving and receiving gifts \\nas well as donations and sponsoring), antitrust and competition law, \\nanti-money laundering and data protection. In training events and \\nthrough various other communication formats, Group Compliance \\naddresses topics directly related to everyday compliance issues \\nand challenges. \\nContinental introduced the Business Partner Code of Conduct to \\nprevent compliance violations by suppliers, service providers, rep-\\nresentatives or similar third parties. This must be recognized as a \\nbasic requirement for doing business with Continental. \\nIn the context of detection, Continental has set up an Integrity Hot-\\nline to give employees and third parties outside the Continental \\nGroup the opportunity to report violations of legal regulations, its \\nfundamental values and ethical standards. Information on any kind \\nof potential violations, including accounting manipulation, can be \\nreported anonymously via this hotline. The hotline is available \\nworldwide in many different languages. Group Internal Audit rigor-\\nously pursues any and all substantiated leads.  \\nDetection also includes the support of regular and incident-related \\naudits conducted by Group Internal Audit. Compliance-related issues \\nare also the subject of regular audits by Group Internal Audit. \\nResponses are aimed at implementing measures as a consequence \\nof identified compliance violations. Group Compliance is involved in \\ndecision-making on measures that may be required, including thor-\\nough analysis to ensure that isolated incidents are not symptoms \\nof failings in the system. In this way, corresponding gaps can be \\nclosed preventively and both the CMS and the ICS can be system-\\natically developed. \\nWhen it comes to preventing violations in the area of technical \\ncompliance, responsibility lies with the Group Quality, Technical \\nCompliance, CBS and Environment group function, supported by \\nthe central functions within the group sectors. The technical com-\\npliance policy as well as the technical compliance management \\nsystem manual and other procedural standards set out how the \\ncompliance management system is designed and implemented. \\nA network of supporting roles in the various functions within the \\ngroup sectors, business areas, segments and sites is being devised \\nand expanded on an ongoing basis in order to support the identifi-\\ncation of risks and other technical compliance considerations. \\nThe third line of our ICS is our Group Internal Audit group function.  \\nGroup Internal Audit provides an independent and objective audit-\\ning and advisory function, applying a systematic, risk-oriented ap-\\nproach to help review, assess and improve the adequacy and effec-\\ntiveness of the organization’s governance systems. Continental’s  \\nExecutive Board authorizes Group Internal Audit to conduct audits \\nin all regions, companies and functions of Continental AG and its  \\naffiliated, fully consolidated subsidiaries worldwide.  \\nGroup Internal Audit prepares an annual risk-oriented audit plan \\nthat is submitted to Continental’s Executive Board for review and \\napproval. In addition to its planned general audits, Group Internal \\nAudit also conducts special investigations. These are based on tips \\nand information about fraudulent acts received from internal or  \\nexternal sources such as the Integrity Hotline. \\nGroup Internal Audit regularly reports its audit and investigation re-\\nsults to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. Significant \\nrisks and potential improvements to internal controls are presented \\nas part of the reporting to the aforementioned bodies. The imple-\\nmentation by management of the measures recommended in the \\ncourse of audits is also monitored by Group Internal Audit and re-\\nported to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. \\nMain characteristics of the internal control and risk \\nmanagement system with respect to the accounting process \\n(Sections 289 (4) and 315 (4) of the German Commercial Code \\n(Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB)) \\nPursuant to Sections 289 (4) and 315 (4) HGB, the main characteris-\\ntics of the internal control and risk management system with respect \\nto the accounting process must be described. All parts of the RMS \\nand the ICS that could have a material effect on the annual and con-\\nsolidated financial statements must be included in the reporting. \\nThe consolidated financial statements of Continental AG are pre-\\npared on the basis of standard reporting by the subsidiaries in-\\ncluded in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with \\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Reporting is per-\\nformed in compliance with IFRS and with the accounting manual \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n78\\napplicable throughout the Continental Group. The consolidation of \\nsubsidiaries, debt, and income and expenses as well as the elimina-\\ntion of intercompany profits and losses is performed at corporate \\nlevel. \\nThe effectiveness of the financial reporting ICS is evaluated in ma-\\njor areas by carrying out effectiveness tests in the reporting units \\non a quarterly basis. In addition, Group Internal Audit reviews the \\nefficiency and effectiveness of control processes as well as compli-\\nance with internal and external requirements. If any weaknesses \\nare identified, the Continental Group’s management initiates the \\nnecessary measures. \\nMain characteristics of the risk management system \\nIn the GRC and RMS policies adopted by the Executive Board, Conti-\\nnental has defined the general conditions for integrated GRC and \\nthe risk management system that regulates the identification, as-\\nsessment, management, reporting and documentation of risks. In \\naddition, this also further increases corporate-wide risk awareness \\nand establishes the framework for a uniform risk culture.  \\nThe GRC system incorporates all components of risk reporting and \\nthe examination of the effectiveness of the financial reporting ICS. \\nRisks are identified, assessed and reported at the organizational \\nlevel that is also responsible for managing the identified risks. A \\nmulti-stage assessment process is used to involve also the higher-\\nlevel organizational units. The GRC system thus includes all report-\\ning levels, from the company level to the top corporate level. \\nAt the corporate level, the responsibilities of the GRC Committee in-\\nclude identifying material risks for the Continental Group, based on \\na multi-stage reporting process, as well as complying with and im-\\nplementing the GRC and RMS policies. The GRC Committee regu-\\nlarly informs the Executive Board and the Audit Committee of the \\nSupervisory Board of the material risks, any weaknesses in the con-\\ntrol system and measures taken. Moreover, the auditor is required \\nto report to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board regard-\\ning any material weaknesses in the financial reporting ICS which \\nthey have identified as part of their audit activities. \\nA period under consideration of one year is always applied when \\nevaluating risks and opportunities. Risks and their effects are as-\\nsessed using an end-to-end gross and net assessment methodol-\\nogy that helps to identify the impact of risk mitigation measures. \\nRisks are assessed primarily according to quantitative criteria in \\nvarious categories. If a risk cannot be assessed quantitatively, then \\nit is assessed qualitatively based on the potential negative effects \\nits occurrence would have on achieving corporate goals and based \\non other qualitative criteria such as the impact on Continental’s \\nreputation. Risks and opportunities are not offset. \\nMaterial individual risks for the Continental Group are identified \\nfrom all the reported risks based on the probability of occurrence \\nand the potential amount of damage that would be caused in the \\nperiod under consideration. Quantified risks are based on EBIT  \\neffect and free cash flow effect. \\nThe individual risks that Continental has classified as material and \\nthe aggregated risks that have been assigned to risk categories are \\nall described in the report on risks and opportunities, provided the \\npotential negative effect of an individual risk or the sum of risks in-\\ncluded in a category exceeds €100 million in the period under con-\\nsideration or there is a significant negative impact on the corporate \\ngoals. \\nThe risk inventory, aggregated using a Monte Carlo simulation, is \\ncompared with the risk-bearing capacity determined on the report-\\ning date, taking into account possible material interactions and \\nquantitative assumptions on qualitatively assessed risks, and is sup-\\nplemented by a qualitative assessment by the GRC Committee on \\noverarching non-quantifiable risks in order to derive a statement on \\nthe potential risk to the Continental Group.  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n79\\nLocal management can utilize various instruments for risk assess-\\nment, such as predefined risk categories (e.g. exchange-rate risks, \\nproduct-liability risks, legal risks) and assessment criteria, centrally \\ndeveloped function-specific questionnaires as well as the financial \\nreporting ICS’s process and control descriptions. The key controls \\nin business processes (purchase to pay, order to cash, asset man-\\nagement, HR, IT authorizations, the financial statement closing pro-\\ncess and sustainability reporting) are thus tested with respect to \\ntheir effectiveness. \\nAll major subsidiaries carry out a semiannual assessment of busi-\\nness-related risks and regular bottom-up identification and evalua-\\ntion of compliance risks in the GRC system’s IT-aided risk manage-\\nment application. Any quality, legal and compliance cases that have \\nactually occurred are also taken into account when assessing these \\nrisks. The GRC system likewise encompasses the tax compliance \\nmanagement system, the customs compliance management sys-\\ntem and the export control compliance management system in  \\norder to ensure standard and regular review and reporting of perti-\\nnent risks. The quarterly financial reporting ICS completes regular \\nGRC reporting.  \\nIn the reporting year, Continental further developed its process for \\nidentifying and reporting strategic risks and opportunities. Any new \\nmaterial risks arising ad hoc between regular reporting dates have \\nto be reported immediately and considered by the GRC Committee. \\nThese also include risks identified in the audits performed by group \\nfunctions. \\nIn addition to the risk analyses carried out by the reporting units as \\npart of integrated GRC, audits are also performed by Group Internal \\nAudit. Furthermore, the various controlling functions analyze the \\nkey figures provided as part of this reporting process at corporate \\nand group-sector level in order to assess the effects of potential \\nrisks. \\nFor each risk identified, the responsible management team initiates \\nappropriate countermeasures which, for material risks, are also doc-\\numented in the GRC system. The GRC Committee monitors and \\nconsolidates the material risks and suitable countermeasures at the \\ncorporate level. It regularly reports to the Executive Board and rec-\\nommends further measures if needed. The Executive Board dis-\\ncusses and resolves the measures and reports to the Supervisory \\nBoard’s Audit Committee. The responsible bodies continually moni-\\ntor the development of all identified risks and the progress of ac-\\ntions initiated. Group Internal Audit regularly audits the risk man-\\nagement process, thereby continually monitoring its effectiveness \\nand further development. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n80\\nAppropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and \\nrisk management system \\nThe Executive Board based its assessment of the appropriateness \\nand effectiveness of the internal control and risk management sys-\\ntem on the findings from routine internal reporting, but in particular \\nalso on function-specific statements on the internal control and risk \\nmanagement system as well as an assessment of these by Group \\nInternal Audit, which were consolidated into an overall statement \\nby the GRC Committee. These statements, together with the overall \\nstatement by the GRC Committee, are intended to offer an over-\\nview of key activities and controls that have been implemented, \\nsummarize measures for reviewing appropriateness and effective-\\nness, and indicate critical weaknesses in the control system as well \\nas any related improvement measures. \\nThe function-specific statements, collected on the basis of a risk-\\noriented selection process, included various aspects in accordance \\nwith the implemented Three Lines Model. In the first line, docu-\\nmented processes and controls were checked with respect to \\nwhether these were in place and had been implemented, as was \\nany communication relating to these elements. Responsibility for \\nguidelines and process flows lies in particular with the second line, \\nwhich – within the scope of the review of the appropriateness and \\neffectiveness of the internal control and risk management system, \\nincluding the compliance management system – is generally satis-\\nfied with respect to the status of implementation of the regulations, \\nwhich is done on the basis of spot checks as well as through appli-\\ncation of external supporting documentation such as certification \\nin line with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), \\nthe Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX) \\nand the International Automotive Task Force (IATF). These not only \\nreinforce compliance with regulatory provisions, but also under-\\nscore the appropriate and effective operation of governance sys-\\ntems implemented at Continental in accordance with industry \\nstandards. The function-specific statements were also strengthened \\nthis year by formalizing and expanding the ICS. In addition to the fi-\\nnancial reporting ICS, key controls underwent a formalized, stand-\\nardized and risk-oriented review to ensure a holistic ICS within the \\norganization. This review was conducted for a selected part of the \\norganization. Monitoring the ICS and the RMS is one of the core \\ntasks of Group Internal Audit, as the third line. As part of its audits, \\nGroup Internal Audit assesses the implementation of risk-control \\nmeasures and internal controls, conducted with the help of recog-\\nnized standards and methods. Deviations and weaknesses noted \\nare summarized in a report for the relevant persons responsible, \\nand any improvement measures initiated. Significant risks and po-\\ntential improvements to internal controls are presented as part of \\nthe reporting to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. The \\nimplementation by management of the measures recommended in \\nthe course of audits is also monitored by Group Internal Audit and \\nreported to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. \\nBased on the statements from the respective functional areas, the \\nassessment of these by Group Internal Audit and the consolidated \\noverall statement by the GRC Committee, no matters have come to \\nthe Executive Board’s attention that would suggest that the internal \\ncontrol and risk management system, including the compliance \\nmanagement system, was inappropriate or ineffective in any material \\nrespects in fiscal 2024. \\nThe ICS and RMS, including the CMS, of Continental AG is moreover \\nundergoing a continuous process of improvement in order to expand \\nexisting processes and controls and meet new regulatory challenges. \\nIn the reporting year, this continuous process of improvement in-\\ncluded implementing a technical compliance management system \\n(tCMS), further strengthening data compliance, further developing \\nthe ICS in the area of sustainability, as well as various measures \\nwithin the IT organization. Further progress was therefore made on \\nformalizing an integrated ICS in the reporting year. In the course  \\nof reorganizing the company, additional measures are being imple-\\nmented with the aim of improving governance systems, such as \\nstrengthening cybersecurity, introducing various measures in the \\ntax area and in sales organizations, and further developing the tCMS. \\nIn addition, work is being continued as part of cross-functional pro-\\njects on adopting a more integrative approach and on increasing \\ntransparency within processes and decision-making. \\nNevertheless, there are inherent limitations to any ICS or RMS, in-\\ncluding the CMS. Even a system considered appropriate and effec-\\ntive does not offer any guarantee that all actual risks or possible  \\nviolations – in particular, those that are targeted and intentional – \\nwill be uncovered in advance or that any process disruptions can \\nbe entirely ruled out. \\nThe Audit Committee is systematically involved in monitoring the \\nICS and RMS, including the CMS. It deals in particular with oversee-\\ning the financial reporting process, the effectiveness of the ICS and \\nRMS, as well as the internal audit system. \\nOpportunity management \\nAs part of our opportunity management activities, we assess market \\nand economic analyses and changes in legal requirements (e.g. with \\nregard to fuel consumption and emission standards as well as safety \\nregulations). In addition, we deal with the corresponding effects on \\nthe sectors and markets relevant to us, our production factors and \\nthe composition and further development of our product portfolio. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n81\\nThe order of the risk categories and individual risks presented \\nwithin the four risk groups reflects the current assessment of the \\nrelative risk exposure for Continental and thus provides an indication \\nof the current significance of these risks. If no quantitative information \\non the amount of damage is provided, the assessment is carried out \\non the basis of qualitative criteria. Unless the emphasis is placed on a \\nspecific group sector, the risks apply to all group sectors. \\nFinancial Risks \\nContinental is exposed to risks in connection with its financing \\nagreements and the syndicated loan.  \\nContinental is subject to risks in connection with its financing \\nagreements. Risks arise from the bonds that Continental AG and \\nConti-Gummi-Finance B.V., Maastricht, Netherlands, have issued as \\npart of the Debt Issuance Programme (DIP). These financing agree-\\nments contain covenants that could limit Continental’s capacity to \\ntake action as well as change-of-control provisions.  \\nIn order to finance current business activities as well as investments \\nand payment obligations, a syndicated loan agreement is in place, \\nfrom which risks may arise. Under the terms of the syndicated loan \\nagreement, the lenders have the right to demand repayment of the \\nloan in the event of a change of control at Continental AG. \\nThe requirements for and consequences of a change in control in \\naccordance with the terms of the bonds or the syndicated loan \\nagreement are described in detail in the Additional Disclosures and \\nNotes Pursuant to Sections 289a and 315a HGB section on pages \\n73 and 74. The loans and bonds cited here could also immediately \\nbecome due and payable if other financing agreements of more \\nthan €75 million are not repaid on time or are prematurely called \\nfor repayment. Continental continuously monitors compliance with \\nthe applicable conditions. \\nThe committed volume of the syndicated loan consists of a revolv-\\ning tranche of €4.0 billion (due in December 2026). As at the end \\nof fiscal 2024, the revolving tranche had not been utilized.  \\nContinental is exposed to risks associated with changes in \\ncurrency exchange rates and hedging. \\nContinental operates worldwide and is therefore exposed to finan-\\ncial risks that arise from changes in exchange rates. This could re-\\nsult in losses if assets denominated in currencies with a falling ex-\\nchange rate lose value and/or liabilities denominated in currencies \\nwith a rising exchange rate appreciate. In addition, fluctuations in \\nexchange rates could intensify or reduce fluctuations in the prices \\nof raw materials in euros, as Continental sources a considerable \\nportion of its raw materials in foreign currency. As a result of these \\nfactors, fluctuations in exchange rates can influence Continental’s \\nearnings situation. \\nExternal and internal transactions involving the delivery of prod-\\nucts and services to third parties and companies of the Continental \\nGroup can result in cash inflows and outflows that are denominated \\nin currencies other than the functional currency of the respective \\nsubsidiary of the Continental Group (transaction risk). To the extent \\nthat cash outflows of the respective subsidiary of the Continental \\nGroup in any one foreign currency are not offset by cash flows re-\\nsulting from operational business in the same currency, the remain-\\ning net exchange-rate risk is hedged on a case-by-case basis using \\nthe appropriate derivative instruments, particularly currency for-\\nwards, currency swaps and currency options with a term of up to \\n12 months.  \\nMoreover, Continental is exposed to exchange-rate risks arising \\nfrom external and internal loan agreements that result in cash in-\\nflows and outflows denominated in currencies other than the func-\\ntional currency of the respective subsidiary of the Continental \\nGroup. These exchange-rate risks are in general hedged by using \\nappropriate derivative instruments, particularly currency forwards, \\ncurrency swaps and cross-currency interest-rate swaps. Any hedg-\\ning transactions executed in the form of derivative instruments can \\nresult in losses. \\nIn order to quantify the possible effects of transaction-related ex-\\nchange-rate risks from financial instruments on the earnings posi-\\ntion of the Continental Group, transaction currencies with a signifi-\\ncant exchange-rate risk within the next 12 months are identified \\nbased on current net exposure. If the exchange rates of these cur-\\nrencies all develop disadvantageously for Continental at the same \\ntime, then the hypothetical negative effect on the Continental \\nGroup’s earnings position, calculated based on a 10% change in  \\nthe current closing rate, would amount to between €400 million \\nand €500 million. \\nContinental is exposed to default risks in connection with cash \\nand cash equivalents, derivative instruments and interest-\\nbearing investments. \\nIn order to minimize the default risk for cash and cash equivalents, \\nderivative instruments and interest-bearing investments, Continen-\\ntal generally uses banks that it has classified as core banks on the \\nbasis of defined criteria. As a general rule, these banks should have \\nat least one investment-grade credit rating from one of the global \\nrating agencies. The default risk can therefore be considered very \\nlow. The creditworthiness of the core banks – and of other banks \\nwith which investments are made, loans are granted or derivative \\ninstruments are traded in derogation from the core bank principle \\nfor operational or regulatory reasons – is continuously monitored. \\nNot only the credit ratings but also in particular the premiums for \\ninsuring against credit default risks (credit default swaps, CDSs) are \\nmonitored, provided this information is available. In addition, Conti-\\nnental sets investment limits for each bank and trading limits for \\nderivative instruments. The amount of these limits is based on the \\ncreditworthiness of the respective bank. Compliance with these  \\nlimits is continuously monitored. Within the internally defined risk \\ngroups, the cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing invest-\\nments and positive (net) fair values of derivative instruments held \\nat banks assigned to a higher risk group amount to around \\n€200 million. \\nMaterial Risks  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n82\\nRisks Related to the Markets in which \\nContinental Operates \\nContinental could be exposed to material risks in connection \\nwith a global financial and economic crisis. \\nWith a 62% share of consolidated sales, the automotive industry – \\nwith the exception of the replacement business – is Continental’s \\nmost important customer group. The remainder of its sales are \\ngenerated in the replacement or industrial markets, mainly in the \\nreplacement market for passenger-car and truck tires and to a \\nlesser extent in the non-automotive end markets of the other  \\ngroup sectors. \\nThe year under review was characterized by a weak economic en-\\nvironment and declining automotive production. Should this trend \\ncontinue or be exacerbated further by a general economic down-\\nturn, it would likely adversely affect Continental’s sales and earnings. \\nIn the year under review, Continental’s five largest OEM customers \\n(BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and VW) \\ngenerated approximately 33% of its sales. If Continental loses one \\nof more of its OEM customers or if supply contracts are terminated \\nprematurely, the original investments made by Continental to sup-\\nply such products or outstanding receivables from the customers \\ncould be wholly or partially lost.  \\nMoreover, Continental generated 49% of its 2024 total sales in Eu-\\nrope and 20% in Germany alone. By comparison, 26% of Continen-\\ntal’s total sales in 2024 were generated in North America, 21% in \\nAsia-Pacific and 4% in other countries. Therefore, in the event of a \\nprolonged economic downturn in Europe, particularly in Germany, \\nfor example, Continental’s business and earnings situation could be \\naffected more extensively than that of its competitors. Furthermore, \\nthe automotive and tire markets in Europe and North America are \\nlargely saturated. To minimize this dependence, Continental is striv-\\ning to improve its regional sales balance, particularly by generating \\nmore sales in emerging markets and especially in Asia.  \\nContinental is exposed to geopolitical risks. \\nCurrent geopolitical developments such as the ongoing war in \\nUkraine, the conflict in the Middle East and the conflict between \\nChina and Taiwan could have a major impact on Continental’s sales \\nand procurement markets. These include sanctions and other risks \\nin supply chains as well as unforeseeable effects on the global \\neconomy. Continental is constantly monitoring current develop-\\nments and deriving possible scenarios and necessary measures. \\nContinental is exposed to risks associated with additional or \\nhigher tariffs. \\nDue to the ongoing trend toward protectionism and escalating \\ntrade conflicts around the world, Continental sees itself at risk from \\nadditional or higher tariffs on automobiles as well as on the prod-\\nucts, components and raw materials it supplies or purchases, both \\ndirectly and indirectly. These tariffs could cause demand for Conti-\\nnental’s products to drop and costs to increase, which would have \\nan adverse effect on Continental’s business and earnings situation. \\nWith regard to the USA in particular, there is currently uncertainty \\nas to when and to what extent corresponding tariffs and possible \\ncountermeasures by other countries can be expected. Continental \\nis continuously examining the possible effects and corresponding \\nmeasures to minimize risk. \\nContinental operates in a cyclical industry. \\nWith a 62% share of consolidated sales, the automotive industry – \\nwith the exception of the replacement business – is Continental’s \\nmost important customer group. Global production of vehicles and, \\nas a result, sales to OEMs are subjected to major fluctuations in \\nsome cases. They depend, among other things, on general eco-\\nnomic conditions, disposable income, and household consumer \\nspending and preferences, which can be affected by a number of \\nfactors, including fuel costs as well as the availability and cost of \\nconsumer financing. As the volume of automotive production fluc-\\ntuates, the demand for Continental’s products also fluctuates, as \\nOEMs generally do not commit to purchasing minimum quantities \\nfrom their suppliers or to fixed prices. It is difficult to predict future \\ndevelopments in the markets Continental serves, which also makes \\nit harder to estimate the requirements for production capacity. As \\nContinental’s business is characterized by high fixed costs, it is thus \\nexposed to the risk that fixed costs are not fully covered in the event \\nof a prolonged decline in demand and the resulting underutilization \\nof its facilities (particularly in Automotive). Conversely, should the \\nmarkets in which Continental operates grow faster than anticipated, \\nthere could be insufficient capacity to meet customer demand. To \\nreduce the impact of the potential risk resulting from this depend-\\nence on the automotive industry, Continental is strengthening its \\nreplacement business and industrial business, including by means \\nof acquisitions.  \\nContinental is exposed to fluctuations in the prices of raw \\nmaterials and electronic components as well as the risk of \\nrising logistics costs. \\nFor the Automotive group sector, higher prices for raw materials \\nand electronic components in particular can result in cost increases. \\nThe Tires and ContiTech group sectors mainly use natural and syn-\\nthetic rubber as well as oil-based raw materials. The prices for these \\nraw materials and components are exposed to sometimes consid-\\nerable fluctuations worldwide, although the volatility of the prices \\nfor metal and crude oil has eased. At present, Continental does not \\nactively hedge the risk of rising prices of electronic components or \\nraw materials by using derivative instruments. Increases in logistics \\ncosts can also occur. If the company is not able to compensate for \\nthe increased costs or to pass them on to customers, these price \\nincreases could reduce Continental’s earnings by €100 million to \\n€200 million. \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n83\\nRisks Related to Continental’s Business \\nOperations \\nContinental depends on a limited number of key suppliers for \\ncertain products.  \\nContinental is subject to the potential risk of unavailability of certain \\nraw materials and production materials. Although Continental’s \\ngeneral policy is to source product components from a number of \\ndifferent suppliers, single sourcing cannot always be avoided and, \\nconsequently, Continental is dependent on certain suppliers, in  \\nparticular with respect to certain products manufactured by Auto-\\nmotive as well as in Tires and ContiTech. Since Continental’s pro-\\ncurement logistics are mostly organized on a just-in-time or just- \\nin-sequence basis, supply delays, cancellations, strikes, insufficient \\nquantities or inadequate quality can lead to interruptions in produc-\\ntion and therefore have a negative impact on Continental’s busi-\\nness operations in these areas. Continental tries to limit these risks \\nby endeavoring to select suppliers carefully and monitor them reg-\\nularly. However, if one of Continental’s suppliers is unable to meet \\nits delivery obligations (e.g. due to insolvency, destruction of pro-\\nduction plants as a result of natural disasters or refusal to perform \\nfollowing a change in control), or if corresponding deliveries are af-\\nfected by sanctions due to geopolitical disputes, Continental may \\nbe unable to source input products from other suppliers on short \\nnotice at the required volume. Such developments and events can \\ntherefore cause delays in the delivery or completion of Continental \\nproducts or projects and could result in Continental having to pur-\\nchase products or services from third parties at higher costs or even \\nto financially support its own suppliers. Furthermore, in many cases \\nOEM customers have approval rights with respect to the suppliers \\nused by Continental, which could make it impossible for Continen-\\ntal to source input products from other suppliers upon short notice \\nif the relevant OEM customer has not already approved other sup-\\npliers at an earlier point in time and which could lead to order can-\\ncellations. Claims for damages on a considerable scale can also not \\nbe ruled out. Furthermore, Continental’s reputation among OEM \\ncustomers could suffer, with the possible consequence that they \\nselect a different supplier.  \\nContinental is exposed to information-technology risks. \\nWith regard to its business and production processes, its products \\nand its internal and external communication, Continental is highly \\ndependent on centralized and standardized information-technol-\\nogy systems and networks. These systems and networks as well as \\nthe products themselves are potentially exposed to the risk of vari-\\nous forms of cybercrime as well as damage and disruption that can \\nhave a wide range of other causes. In hacker attacks, third parties \\ncould attempt to gain unauthorized access to confidential information \\nand data that is stored, processed or communicated in the systems \\nand networks, or to the systems themselves. In addition, data, prod-\\nucts and systems could be blocked, damaged, controlled or destroyed \\nas a result of becoming infected with viruses or malware. \\nAlthough Continental has taken appropriate precautions to manage \\nthe risks associated with system and network disruptions and cor-\\nresponding attacks, a prolonged outage in a computer center or \\ntelecommunication network or a comparable incident could result \\nin systems or networks becoming unexpectedly unavailable over \\nan extended period. The measures taken to minimize such risks in-\\nclude technical and organizational precautions such as duplicated \\ndata storage and contingency plans, as well as suitable training \\nmeasures that are continuously expanded, particularly to raise aware-\\nness of the growing threat from cybercrime. Furthermore, the find-\\nings from the investigation into the cyberattack in August 2022 were \\ntaken into consideration with respect to strengthening IT systems. \\nShould the precautions taken prove insufficient to adequately pro-\\ntect the systems, networks, products and information, Continental \\ncould suffer considerable damage and disadvantages as a result of \\noutages or the knowledge and use of its information by third parties. \\nContinental is exposed to risks associated with warranty and \\nproduct liability claims. \\nIn its quality strategy, Continental has defined the framework condi-\\ntions for all quality-related activities and ascribes the highest prior-\\nity to quality. However, Continental is constantly subject to product \\nliability claims and proceedings alleging violations of due care, vio-\\nlation of warranty obligations or material defects, and claims arising \\nfrom breaches of contract due to recalls or government proceed-\\nings. Any such lawsuits, proceedings and other claims could result \\nin increased costs for Continental. Moreover, defective products \\ncould result in loss of sales and loss of customer and market ac-\\nceptance. Such risks are insured up to levels considered economi-\\ncally reasonable by Continental, but its insurance coverage could \\nprove insufficient in individual cases. Additionally, any defect in one \\nof Continental’s products (in particular tires and other safety-related \\nproducts) could also have a considerable adverse effect on the \\ncompany’s reputation and market perception. This could in turn \\nhave a negative impact on Continental’s sales and income. Moreo-\\nver, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly requiring a contribution \\nfrom their suppliers for potential product liability, warranty and re-\\ncall claims. For example, the MK C2 integrated brake system pro-\\nduced for the BMW Group is currently being partly replaced. Based \\non the systems that have already been replaced and our current \\nunderstanding, we continue to assume that only a small proportion \\nof delivered brake systems will actually need to be replaced. In ad-\\ndition, Continental is subject to continuing efforts by its customers \\nto change contract terms and conditions concerning the contribu-\\ntion to warranty and recall cost. Furthermore, Continental manufac-\\ntures many products pursuant to OEM customer specifications and \\nquality requirements. If the products manufactured and delivered \\nby Continental do not meet the requirements stipulated by its OEM \\ncustomers at the agreed date of delivery, production of the relevant \\nproducts is generally discontinued until the cause of the product \\ndefect has been identified and remedied. Under certain circum-\\nstances, this could lead to losses of sales and earnings. Further-\\nmore, Continental’s OEM customers could potentially claim dam-\\nages, even if the cause of the defect is remedied at a later point in \\ntime. Moreover, failure to fulfill quality requirements could have an \\nadverse effect on the market acceptance of Continental’s other \\nproducts and its market reputation in various market segments. \\nAs the quantifiable risks are individual matters, no further disclo-\\nsures will be made in accordance with IAS 37.92 and GAS 20.154 \\nso as not to adversely affect the company’s interests. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n84\\nContinental is exposed to risks in connection with its pension \\ncommitments. \\nContinental provides defined benefit pension plans in Germany, the \\nUSA, the UK and certain other countries. As at December 31, 2024, \\nthe pension obligations amounted to €5,632 million. These existing \\nobligations are financed predominantly through externally invested \\npension plan assets. In 2006, Continental established legally inde-\\npendent trust funds under contractual trust arrangements (CTAs) \\nfor the funding of pension obligations of certain subsidiaries in Ger-\\nmany. In 2007, Continental assumed additional CTAs in connection \\nwith the acquisition of Siemens VDO. As at December 31, 2024, \\nContinental’s net pension obligations (defined benefit obligations \\nless the fair value of plan assets) amounted to €2,540 million. \\nContinental’s externally invested plan assets are funded by exter-\\nnally managed funds and insurance companies. While Continental \\ngenerally prescribes the investment strategies applied by these \\nfunds and takes these into account when selecting external fund \\nmanagers, it does not have any influence over their individual in-\\nvestment decisions. The assets are invested in different asset clas-\\nses, including equity, fixed-income securities, real estate and other \\ninvestment vehicles. The values attributable to the externally in-\\nvested plan assets are subject to fluctuations in the capital markets \\nthat are beyond Continental’s influence. Unfavorable developments \\nin the capital markets could result in a substantial coverage short-\\nfall for these pension obligations, resulting in a significant increase \\nin Continental’s net pension obligations. \\nAny such increase in Continental’s net pension obligations could \\nadversely affect Continental’s financial condition due to an increased \\nadditional outflow of funds to finance the pension obligations. Also, \\nContinental is exposed to risks associated with longevity and inter-\\nest-rate changes in connection with its pension commitments, as \\nan interest-rate decrease could have an adverse effect on Continen-\\ntal’s liabilities under these pension plans. Furthermore, certain US-\\nbased subsidiaries of Continental have entered into obligations to \\nmake contributions to healthcare costs of former employees and \\nretirees. Accordingly, Continental is exposed to the potential risk \\nthat these costs may increase in the future. \\nIf the discount rates used to calculate net pension obligations were \\nto decrease by 0.5 percentage points at the end of the year, all other \\nthings being equal, this would lead to a rise in net pension obliga-\\ntions of anywhere from €400 million to €500 million, which could \\nnot be reduced by taking measures to minimize risk. However, this \\nwould not affect EBIT. \\nContinental is exposed to risks from trade restrictions, \\nsanctions and export controls. \\nDue to the global alignment of the economic activity of the Conti-\\nnental Group, there are business risks with respect to embargoes, \\nsanctions and export controls. As a global company, Continental \\nalso has business relations with customers and partners based in \\ncountries that are – or may be in the future – subject to export re-\\nstrictions, embargoes, economic sanctions or other forms of trade \\nrestrictions. In addition to the fundamental influence that such re-\\nstrictions have on the business activity of the Continental Group,  \\nviolations of relevant provisions may lead to considerable penalties, \\nadministrative sanctions, damage to the company’s reputation, as \\nwell as claims for damages. Possible risks of such violations are mit-\\nigated as part of the export control compliance management sys-\\ntem. Furthermore, Continental may also be forced, through new \\ntrade restrictions, to limit or put an end to business activity in cer-\\ntain countries or regions. \\nContinental could be adversely affected by property loss and \\nbusiness interruption. \\nFire, natural hazards, terrorism, power failures or other disturbances \\nat Continental’s production facilities or within Continental’s supply \\nchain – with customers and with suppliers – can result in severe \\ndamage and loss. Such far-reaching negative consequences can \\nalso arise from political unrest or instability. Due to climate change, \\nthe probability of natural hazards, in particular extreme weather \\nevents, is expected to continue to rise and the extent of damage to \\nincrease. The risks arising from business interruption, loss of pro-\\nduction or the financing of facilities are insured up to levels consid-\\nered economically reasonable by Continental, but its insurance cov-\\nerage could prove insufficient in individual cases. Furthermore, \\nsuch events could injure or damage individuals, third-party prop-\\nerty or the environment, which could, among other things, lead to \\nconsiderable financial costs for Continental. \\nContinental is exposed to risks in connection with its interest \\nin MC Projects B.V. \\nContinental and Compagnie Financière Michelin SAS, Clermont-Fer-\\nrand, France (Michelin), each hold a 50% stake in MC Projects B.V., \\nMaastricht, Netherlands, a company to which Michelin contributed \\nthe rights to the Uniroyal brand for Europe as well as for certain \\ncountries outside Europe. In turn, MC Projects B.V. licensed to Conti-\\nnental certain rights to use the Uniroyal brand on or in connection \\nwith tires in Europe and elsewhere. Under the terms of the agree-\\nment concluded in this connection, both the agreement and the \\nUniroyal license can be terminated if a major competitor in the tire \\nbusiness acquires more than 50% of the voting rights of Continen-\\ntal AG or of its tire business. Furthermore, in this case Michelin also \\nhas the right to acquire a majority in MC Projects B.V. and to have \\nMC Projects B.V. increase its minority stake in the manufacturing \\ncompany Continental Barum s.r.o., Otrokovice, Czech Republic – \\none of Continental’s largest tire plants in Europe – to 51%. These \\nevents could have an adverse effect on the business and earnings \\nposition of Continental’s Tires group sector.  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n85\\nLegal, Tax and Environmental Risks \\nContinental could be threatened with fines and claims for \\ndamages for alleged or actual unlawful behavior. \\nDespite the compliance management system in place at Continen-\\ntal, the global nature of the Continental Group’s business activities \\nmeans there is a possibility that unlawful behavior (e.g. corruption, \\nfraud, violations of antitrust and competition law, money laundering) \\ncould occur in individual cases or that Continental could be accused \\nof unlawful behavior. This alleged or actual unlawful behavior could \\nlead to fines or claims for damages. Significant proceedings in this \\ncontext are outlined below.  \\nIn May 2005, the Brazilian competition authorities (Conselho Ad-\\nministrativo de Defesa Econômica, CADE) opened investigations \\nagainst Continental’s Brazilian subsidiary Continental Brasil Indus-\\ntria Automotiva Ltda., Guarulhos, Brazil (CBIA), following a com-\\nplaint of anticompetitive behavior in the area of commercialization \\nof tachographs. On August 18, 2010, the Brazilian antitrust authori-\\nties determined an “invitation to cartel” and imposed a fine of BRL \\n12 million (around €2 million) on CBIA, which was then reduced to \\nBRL 11 million (around €2 million). CBIA denies the accusation that \\nit has infringed Brazilian antitrust law. Although the court of first in-\\nstance appealed to by CBIA upheld the decision, on CBIA’s further \\nappeal the next higher court annulled this decision and remanded \\nthe matter. In February 2023, the court of first instance rendered a \\nverdict against CBIA and lifted the ban on the enforcement of the \\nfinancial penalty against CBIA (at that time an amount of around \\nBRL 34 million [around €5 million]). CBIA filed a motion for clarifica-\\ntion requesting that the preliminary injunction against enforcement \\nremain in full force up until a final and unappealable ruling is made. \\nThis motion was denied, and CBIA filed an appeal against this deci-\\nsion. In December 2024, CBIA participated in an initiative by the \\nBrazilian antitrust authorities (Conselho Administrativo de Defesa \\nEconômica, CADE) to settle the long-standing proceedings without \\nadmission of guilt by the company in exchange for a considerable \\nreduction in the fine. Accordingly, CBIA concluded a settlement \\nagreement with CADE under which CBIA must pay BRL 14 million \\n(around €2 million) to CADE in 2025. CBIA has withdrawn its final \\nappeal (on the condition that CADE’s settlement measures are final-\\nized). Once the payment has been made and the appeal withdrawn, \\nthe case will be closed. Third parties may, in addition, claim dam-\\nages from CBIA. \\nOn October 2, 2006, South African antitrust authorities received a \\ncomplaint from a third party accusing several South African tire \\nmanufacturers of alleged antitrust behavior, including Continental \\nTyre South Africa (Pty.) Ltd., Port Elizabeth, South Africa (CTSA), a \\nsubsidiary of Continental. On August 31, 2010, the South African \\nantitrust authorities came to the conclusion that CTSA had violated \\nSouth African antitrust law and referred the matter to the responsi-\\nble antitrust court for decision. CTSA denies the allegation of in-\\nfringements of South African antitrust law. However, the tribunal \\ncould impose a fine of up to 10% of CTSA’s sales. In addition, third \\nparties may also claim damages from CTSA in case of an infringe-\\nment of South African competition law. \\nAs a result of investigations by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nand the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) in connection with \\nsuspected involvement in violations of US and South Korean anti-\\ntrust law in the instrument cluster business, which came to light in \\n2012, the KFTC imposed a fine on Continental Automotive Elec-\\ntronics LLC, Bugang-myeon, South Korea (CAE), at the end of 2013, \\nthe final amount of which was set in 2018 at KRW 32,101 million \\n(around €21 million). In the USA, CAE and Continental Automotive \\nKorea Ltd., Seongnam-si, South Korea, agreed in 2015 to pay a fine \\nof US $4 million (approximately €4 million). In the proceedings re-\\nlating to class action lawsuits filed in the USA and Canada for al-\\nleged damages resulting from the antitrust violations, settlements \\ntotaling US $5 million (around €5 million) were concluded in the \\nUSA in 2018 and settlements totaling around CAN $0.6 million \\n(around €0.4 million) concluded in Canada in 2020. The risk of  \\ninvestigations by other antitrust authorities into this matter and \\nclaims for damages by further alleged victims remain unaffected  \\nby the fines imposed.  \\nAs a result of investigations that came to light in 2014, the Euro-\\npean Commission imposed a fine of €44 million on Continental AG; \\nContinental Teves AG & Co. oHG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; and \\nContinental Automotive GmbH, Hanover, Germany; on February 21, \\n2018, for the unlawful exchange of information. This involved spe-\\ncific brake components. Continental has paid this fine. Customers \\nhave since approached Continental to claim for damages, in some \\ncases for specific amounts. Mercedes-Benz Group AG filed for de-\\nclaratory judgment action with the Hanover District Court against \\nContinental AG and two other companies of the Continental Group \\nin December 2022, which initially related only to claims from remu-\\nneration in 2008/09. This declaratory judgment action was con-\\nverted to an action for performance in April 2024. In April 2023, \\nseveral companies of the Stellantis Group as well as several compa-\\nnies of the Renault Group filed a civil lawsuit in each case against \\nContinental AG and two other companies of the Continental Group \\nas well as several ZF and Bosch companies before the High Court \\nin London, United Kingdom. Both the Renault Group and the Stel-\\nlantis Group have since withdrawn their lawsuits. In addition, two \\nclass action lawsuits have been filed in Canada against Continen-\\ntal AG and several of its subsidiaries. These proceedings were set-\\ntled in November 2024. Final closure of these class action lawsuits \\nis expected in the first half of 2025, subject to court approval. \\nContinental believes that these claims and the lawsuit by Mercedes-\\nBenz are without merit. However, should the lawsuits lead to a judg-\\nment against Continental, the resulting expenses could be substan-\\ntial and exceed the provision set aside for this purpose. In accord-\\nance with IAS 37.92 and GAS 20.154, no further disclosures will be \\nmade with regard to the proceedings and the related measures so \\nas not to adversely affect the company’s interests. \\nOn March 3, 2021, the Brazilian antitrust authorities (CADE), acting \\non the basis of the issues addressed by the European Commission \\nand described above, formally initiated proceedings against Conti-\\nnental Teves AG & Co. oHG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and cer-\\ntain former employees for alleged unlawful exchange of competition-\\nsensitive information concerning hydraulic brake systems. Continen-\\ntal considers it possible that these proceedings will end with a fine. \\nContinental is therefore unable to predict in any reliable way what \\nthe outcome of these proceedings will be. If Continental is found re-\\nsponsible for any violation, CADE could impose a fine on the com-\\npany of 0.1% to 20% of the revenue generated by the company or \\nby the Continental Group in Brazil in the year prior to when the  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n86\\nadministrative proceedings were launched (2020). Non-pecuniary \\npenalties may also be possible. Furthermore, customers purportedly \\naffected by the alleged exchange of information could claim for \\ndamages if indeed a violation of Brazilian antitrust law is established.  \\nSince 2020, the public prosecutor’s office in Hanover has been \\nconducting investigative proceedings against former employees  \\nas well as former board members of Continental AG suspected of \\ncommitting criminal acts and breaches of supervisory duties in \\nconnection with the development and use of illegal defeat devices \\nin diesel and gasoline engines of multiple automotive manufactur-\\ners. The fine proceedings conducted by the public prosecutor’s of-\\nfice in Hanover against Continental AG and other group companies \\nin this regard were legally concluded in the second quarter of \\n2024 by payment of a fine totaling €100 million. The company \\nhad already made appropriate provisions. \\nVitesco Technologies and Continental AG, acting on the basis of \\nand in accordance with contractual provisions, particularly those \\nset forth in the corporate separation agreement concluded as part \\nof the spin-off of Vitesco Technologies, reached an agreement re-\\ngarding the appropriate allocation of costs and liabilities from the \\ninvestigations conducted by the public prosecutor’s offices in \\nFrankfurt am Main (until the end of 2022) and Hanover. Accord-\\ningly, Vitesco Technologies paid Continental €125 million in the \\nthird quarter. \\nAs part of industry-wide searches, the European Commission be-\\ngan conducting a search of the premises of Continental AG on Jan-\\nuary 30, 2024, due to alleged antitrust violations. On the same day, \\nGermany’s Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) searched the \\npremises of TON Tyres Over Night Trading GmbH, Schondra-\\nSchildeck, Germany, a subsidiary of Continental, also due to alleged \\nindustry-wide antitrust violations. Both proceedings are at an early \\nstage. In the event that Continental is responsible for any such vio-\\nlation, the European Commission and the Bundeskartellamt could \\neach impose substantial fines. Furthermore, customers allegedly af-\\nfected by the alleged exchange of information could claim for dam-\\nages. In this context, class action lawsuits have already been filed in \\nthe USA and Canada against Continental and other tire manufac-\\nturers. The lawsuits in the USA have been consolidated before the \\nUnited States District Court, Northern District of Ohio. The defend-\\nant tire manufacturers have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuits \\nand are awaiting the court’s decision. In accordance with IAS 37.92 \\nand GAS 20.154, no further disclosures will be made with regard to \\nthe proceedings and the related measures so as not to adversely \\naffect the company’s interests. \\nSince the first half of 2024, a number of Continental Group compa-\\nnies have been investigated by Italian authorities for failure to sub-\\nmit tax returns for tax periods from 2016 onwards. In conjunction \\nwith this, in October 2024 the Italian authorities began a company \\naudit of Continental AG as the parent company for the fiscal years \\n2016 to 2023. Continental is fully cooperating with the investigat-\\ning authorities and is clarifying this matter internally. Continental \\nhas formed provisions to cover any risks in this regard. In accord-\\nance with IAS 37.92 and GAS 20.154, no further disclosures will  \\nbe made so as not to adversely affect the company’s interests. \\nOn September 24, 2024, the Turkish Competition Authority (TCA) \\nconducted a search of the business premises of Otomotiv Lastikleri \\nTevzi AS (OLTAS), Istanbul, Türkiye, due to alleged antitrust viola-\\ntions. On December 3, 2024, the TCA published its notice of inves-\\ntigation and initiated an in-depth investigation into the matter. The \\nproceedings are at an early stage. Continental is unable to predict \\nin any reliable way what the outcome of these proceedings will be. \\nIn the event that OLTAS is responsible for any violation, the TCA \\ncould impose substantial fines. Furthermore, any customers af-\\nfected by the alleged infringements could claim damages. \\nThere is a risk that Continental could infringe on the industrial \\nproperty rights of third parties. \\nThere is a risk that Continental could infringe on the industrial \\nproperty rights of third parties, since its competitors, suppliers and \\ncustomers also submit a large number of inventions for industrial \\nproperty protection. It is not always possible to determine with cer-\\ntainty whether there are effective and enforceable third-party in-\\ndustrial property rights to certain processes, methods or applica-\\ntions. Therefore, third parties could assert claims (including illegiti-\\nmate ones) of alleged infringements of industrial property rights \\nagainst Continental. As a result, Continental could be required to \\ncease manufacturing, using or marketing the relevant technologies \\nor products in certain countries, or be forced to make changes to \\nmanufacturing processes and/or products. In addition, Continental \\ncould be liable to pay compensation for infringements or could be \\nforced to purchase licenses to continue using technology from \\nthird parties. \\nContinental, for example, supplies telecommunication modules that \\ntransmit vehicle data, enable voice and internet functionality, and \\nare compatible with cellular communication standards. In this re-\\nspect, there is a risk that Continental may now be dependent on  \\nlicenses and the conditions under which they are granted to cus-\\ntomers in order to use patents relating to these standards (stand-\\nard essential patents), especially in the field of telecommunications \\nstandards such as 3G, 4G or 5G, as Continental was in some cases \\ndenied the acquisition of its own licenses in the year under review. \\nContinental has formed provisions to cover the risks of any com-\\npensation payments in this regard. In accordance with IAS 37.92 \\nand GAS 20.154, no further disclosures will be made so as not to \\nadversely affect the company’s interests. \\nContinental could become subject to additional burdensome \\nenvironmental or safety regulations, and new regulations \\ncould adversely affect demand for the company’s products \\nand services. \\nAs a corporation that operates worldwide, Continental must ob-\\nserve a large number of different regulatory systems in numerous \\ncountries that change frequently and are continuously evolving \\nand becoming more stringent, particularly with respect to the envi-\\nronment, chemicals and hazardous materials, as well as health reg-\\nulations. This also applies to air, water and soil pollution regulations \\nand to waste legislation, all of which have recently become more \\nstringent through new laws, particularly in the European Union and \\nthe USA. Continental could be affected in particular by greater re-\\nstrictions on the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). \\nMoreover, Continental’s locations and operations necessitate vari-\\nous permits, and the requirements specified therein must be com-\\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n87\\nplied with. In the past, adjusting to new requirements has necessi-\\ntated investments, and Continental assumes that further investments \\nin this regard will be required in the future. \\nContinental is exposed to risks from legal disputes.  \\nCompanies from the Continental Group are involved in a number  \\nof legal and arbitration proceedings and could become involved in \\nother such proceedings in the future. These proceedings could in-\\nvolve substantial claims for damages or payments, particularly in \\nthe USA. For more information on legal disputes, see Note 36 of \\nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements. \\nContinental could be exposed to tax risks in connection with \\nprevious assessment periods. \\nContinental AG and its subsidiaries operate worldwide and are con-\\ntinuously audited by local tax authorities. Tax estimates made for \\nthe financial statements may differ from how these are interpreted \\nby the tax authorities, for example because of changes to tax legis-\\nlation and the development of case law. Tax risks arise in particular \\nfrom the valuation of cross-border, intercompany deliveries and ser-\\nvices (transfer prices). Through organizational measures, such as \\nmonitoring transfer prices and where necessary carrying out bilat-\\neral appeals procedures, Continental AG monitors and controls the \\ndevelopment of taxation risks and their impact on the consolidated \\nfinancial statements. Tax processes are continuously adapted to \\nnew tax laws and changes to case law. \\nContinental could be unsuccessful in adequately protecting its \\nintellectual property and technical expertise.  \\nContinental’s products and services are highly dependent upon its \\ntechnological know-how and the scope and limitations of its propri-\\netary rights therein. Continental has obtained or applied for a large \\nnumber of patents and other industrial property rights that are of \\nconsiderable importance to its business. The process of obtaining \\npatent protection can be lengthy and expensive. Furthermore, pa-\\ntents may not be granted on currently pending or future applica-\\ntions or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide Conti-\\nnental with meaningful protection or commercial advantage. In ad-\\ndition, although there is a presumption that patents are valid, this \\ndoes not necessarily mean that the patent concerned is effective  \\nor that possible patent claims can be enforced to the degree neces-\\nsary or desired. \\nA major part of Continental’s know-how and trade secrets is not  \\npatented or cannot be protected through industrial property rights. \\nConsequently, there is a risk that certain parts of Continental’s \\nknow-how and trade secrets could be transferred to collaboration \\npartners, customers and suppliers, including Continental’s machin-\\nery suppliers or plant vendors. This poses a risk that competitors \\nwill copy Continental’s know-how without incurring any expenses \\nof their own. Moreover, Continental has concluded a number of  \\nlicense, cross-license, collaboration and development agreements \\nwith its customers, competitors and other third parties under which \\nContinental is granted rights to industrial property and/or know-\\nhow of such third parties. It is possible that license agreements \\ncould be terminated under certain circumstances in the event of \\nthe licensing partner’s insolvency or bankruptcy and/or in the \\nevent of a change of control in either party, leaving Continental \\nwith reduced access to intellectual property rights to commercial-\\nize its own technologies. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n88\\nUnless the emphasis is placed on a specific group sector, the op-\\nportunities apply to all group sectors. \\nThere are opportunities for Continental if the economy \\nperforms better than anticipated. \\nIf the economy in our major sales regions develops better than  \\nanticipated, we expect that demand for vehicles, replacement tires \\nand industrial products will also develop better than we have antici-\\npated. Due to the increased demand for Continental’s products \\namong vehicle manufacturers and industrial clients and in the re-\\nplacement business that would be expected as a consequence, our \\nsales could rise more significantly than expected and there could \\nbe positive effects with regard to fixed cost coverage. Particular im-\\nportance is attached to the European market due to the high share \\nof sales that Continental generates in this region (50%). \\nThere are opportunities for Continental if prices fall on the raw \\nmaterials markets relevant to us. \\nContinental’s earnings situation is affected to a significant extent  \\nby the cost of raw materials, electronic components, logistics and \\nenergy. For Automotive, this particularly relates to the cost of elec-\\ntronic components as well as metals and plastics. The earnings situ-\\nation of Tires and ContiTech is significantly impacted by the cost of \\noil and of natural and synthetic rubber. If prices for natural and syn-\\nthetic rubber in particular decline, this could have a positive impact \\non Continental’s earnings, provided sales prices for rubber prod-\\nucts remain stable.  \\nThe trend toward automated and autonomous driving \\npresents Continental with opportunities. \\nThe trend from assisted driving to automated and autonomous \\ndriving is set to continue. Several vehicle manufacturers plan to of-\\nfer new models with partially automated “Level 2+” and “Level 3” \\nfunctions over the next few years. A key requirement for partially \\nautomated driving is that vehicles are equipped with sensors. To \\ndate, between two and seven sensors for assisted driving have \\nbeen installed per vehicle, depending on their equipment features. \\nEven for partially automated driving, considerably more and also \\nhigher-quality radar, camera and LiDAR sensors are required, de-\\npending on the scope of the functionality. Since Continental is one \\nof the leading providers of advanced driver assistance systems, the \\nincreasing volume of sensors, electronic control units and new soft-\\nware could result in considerable sales and earnings opportunities \\nfor the Automotive group sector. Further opportunities are being \\ncreated for autonomous driving in the commercial vehicle sector in \\nLevel 4. Together with its strategic partner Aurora, Continental is \\nworking on a scalable solution that could lead to recurring sales \\nand earnings opportunities throughout a truck’s entire service life. \\nThere are opportunities for Continental from strategic \\npartnerships, particularly in the Automotive group sector. \\nContinental is increasingly focusing on strategic partnerships in  \\norder to shape the transformation in the automotive sector as effi-\\nciently as possible. Examples of this include the strategic partner-\\nships with the technology companies Ambarella and Aurora. Such \\npartnerships allow the companies involved to contribute their ex-\\npertise and optimize research and development costs, for example. \\nIn addition, the strengths of each company can help ensure a \\nhigher level of innovation and agility when launching products. \\nCost optimization and an improved competitive position – thanks \\nto faster time to market, for example – present Continental with  \\nopportunities.  \\nThe digitalization of vehicles and the services generated as a \\nresult present Continental with opportunities. \\nThe massive amounts of data generated by driver assistance sys-\\ntems and driver information systems as well as the immediate pro-\\ncessing of this data in vehicles require switching the vehicle archi-\\ntecture to the most cutting-edge high-performance computers. This \\n– together with the new software solutions required for this purpose \\n– results in substantial growth potential for Continental with posi-\\ntive effects on its future sales and attainable margins (e.g. Continen-\\ntal Holistic Motion Control software and Smart Cockpit high-perfor-\\nmance computer (HPC); see the Research and Development section). \\nFurthermore, the increasing digitalization of our products gives us \\nthe opportunity to offer our customers software-based services \\nand regular software updates in addition to the product itself, and \\nto open up new markets for mobility services. \\nThere are opportunities for Continental from the increasing \\nuse of artificial intelligence (AI). \\nContinental is working on a large number of AI solutions across all \\ngroup sectors. Some solutions have already been successfully im-\\nplemented. First, this relates to the products and services custom-\\ners acquire from Continental. Additionally, it covers solutions that \\nare used within our business areas and central functions. If greater \\nuse is made of AI, this could help to further optimize internal pro-\\ncesses and increase efficiency. This, in turn, could have a positive \\nimpact on earnings. Parallel to this, factors such as faster time to \\nmarket for our customers can also create opportunities for growth. \\nInnovations for vehicle interiors present Continental with \\nopportunities. \\nMore and more new products are being used in car manufacturing \\nto optimize interaction between driver and vehicle. For the user ex-\\nperience of the future, Continental has developed countless innova-\\ntions such as curved digital 3D displays and temporarily hidden dis-\\nplays. With customer-specific solutions for interior sensor technol-\\nogy and surfaces, Continental is also increasing safety and ease of \\nuse within the vehicle (e.g. Invisible Biometrics Sensing Display; see \\nthe Research and Development section). Since intelligent concepts \\nfor new experiences in the vehicle interior are becoming more and \\nmore important for car buyers, and Continental is one of the lead-\\ning providers of these, increasing demand among car manufactur-\\ners could result in considerable sales and earnings opportunities. \\nThe tire business presents Continental with opportunities. \\nContinental intends to further increase its market share in the \\ngrowth markets of Asia and North America in particular. In the pas-\\nsenger-car tire segment, the global business with tires for electric \\nmobility and ultra-high-performance tires is to be systematically ex-\\npanded. The truck and bus tire business is to be further developed \\nin all regions through Conti360˚ fleet services. Continental’s spe-\\ncialty tire business, which includes not only two-wheel and racing \\ntires but also tires for a variety of industrial applications, is expected \\nto see additional growth as well. Smart, digital tire solutions, such as \\nthe latest ContiConnect generation of sensors, will also make a con-\\ntribution to ambitious sustainability goals and differentiation in the \\nmarket. The market launch of the Conti EfficientPro 5 original-\\nequipment tire for trucks and buses is one example of this (see the \\nMaterial Opportunities \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities \\n89\\nResearch and Development section). In the area of service-based \\ndigital solutions, the Tires group sector of Continental aims to be-\\ncome the leading supplier worldwide by 2030. If Continental suc-\\nceeds in increasing its market share in high-growth segments and \\nin digital solutions and services even more than planned, this is \\nlikely to have positive effects on its sales and earnings. \\nGreater focus on the industrial business presents Continental \\nwith opportunities. \\nWith a possible sale of the Original Equipment Solutions (OESL) \\nbusiness area, the ContiTech group sector is planning to focus on, \\nand in turn strengthen, its profitable industrial business. Growth po-\\ntential in the industrial business results primarily from the increas-\\ning demand for sustainable as well as digital and intelligent solu-\\ntions. In this regard, the ContiTech group sector draws on its long-\\nstanding and detailed knowledge of the industry and materials to \\nopen up new business opportunities. This involves combining a \\nwide range of materials with electronic components and individual \\nservices. Continental is also showcasing how sustainable surface \\nsolutions can be used in vehicle interiors (e.g. materials such as \\nXpreshn; see the Research and Development section). If these new \\nproducts become established more quickly than planned, this \\nwould create corresponding sales and earnings opportunities for \\nContinental. \\nThere are opportunities for Continental from changes in the \\nlegal framework. \\nLegal regulations with the aim of further improving traffic safety \\nprovide an opportunity for rising demand for Continental’s prod-\\nucts. Based on our broad product portfolio for active vehicle safety, \\nwe have developed a wide range of advanced safety systems in re-\\ncent years. Further volume growth is expected as a result of more \\nstringent requirements in various regional safety tests, since an in-\\ncreasing number of safety systems have been recognized as hav-\\ning achieved the very highest level of safety. In addition, more and \\nmore legal requirements in individual countries are being ex-\\npanded to include active safety systems.\\n \\n \\nStatement on Overall Risk and Opportunities \\nSituation \\nIn the opinion of the Executive Board, the overall risk situation of \\nthe Continental Group has not changed significantly in the past  \\nfiscal year.  \\nIt remains to be seen to what extent and for how long current  \\ngeopolitical events, and in particular the associated ongoing tariff \\ndisputes, will continue to affect the automotive industry and the \\nmacroeconomic situation. \\nHowever, the analysis for the year under review did not reveal any \\nrisks, either at the end of the reporting period or at the time the an-\\nnual financial statements were prepared, that individually or collec-\\ntively pose a threat to the company or the Continental Group as a \\ngoing concern. In the opinion of the Executive Board, there are also \\nno discernible risks to the Continental Group as a going concern in \\nthe foreseeable future. \\nConsidering the material opportunities, the overall risk assessment \\nfor the Continental Group presents a reasonable risk and opportu-\\nnities situation, to which our risk-containment measures and our \\ncorporate strategy have been aligned accordingly.  \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Expected Developments \\n90\\nForecast of Macroeconomic \\nDevelopment \\nIn its World Economic Outlook Update (WEO Update) of January \\n2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the global \\neconomy to grow by 3.3% in 2025. Its forecast of slightly higher \\ngrowth than in 2024 reflects the expectation that inflation will con-\\ntinue to fall in a stabilizing global economy. However, the IMF sees \\ndivergences across individual countries. \\nAccording to the IMF, Europe is likely to continue to be character-\\nized by subdued growth in 2025, hampered by weak production \\nfigures and exports on the back of sluggish demand. For the euro-\\nzone, the IMF therefore expects gross domestic product (GDP) to \\nrise by just 1.0% in 2025, including GDP growth in Germany of \\n0.3%. For the UK, it expects GDP to increase by 1.6%. \\nFor the USA, the IMF expects GDP growth of 2.7% in 2025, propped \\nup by a business-friendly policy in the form of deregulation and the \\nFederal Reserve’s less restrictive monetary and fiscal policy. \\nJapan’s economy is expected to return to higher growth rates in \\n2025 after the previous year was severely impacted by supply  \\ndisruptions. The IMF expects its GDP to grow by 1.1% in 2025. \\nFor India, the IMF forecasts a high GDP growth rate of 6.5%, as in \\n2024. Continued strong development is also expected in China as \\na result of fiscal policy support, with the IMF currently estimating \\nGDP growth of 4.6%.  \\nIn other emerging and developing countries, the IMF expects weaker \\neconomic development in 2025 than in 2024. In Brazil, for example, \\nit anticipates a 2.2% increase in GDP. \\nThe IMF’s forecast is based on the assumption that energy prices \\nwill decline in 2025 and interest rates will continue to fall in major \\neconomies.  \\nThe IMF also points toward a number of opportunities and risks. \\nFurther disinflation could have a positive effect, as could a greater \\nthan expected fall in energy prices. Significant risks from the IMF’s \\nperspective include the tense geopolitical situation and increasing \\nprotectionism, for instance in the form of tariffs, trade tensions and \\nreduced market efficiency. This would bring with it a rise in the price \\nof raw materials and disruptions to global supply chains. Further-\\nmore, a renewed increase in inflation could prompt central banks  \\nto raise interest rates. \\nForecast for Key Customer Sectors and \\nSales Regions \\nForecast for production of passenger cars and light \\ncommercial vehicles \\nWe currently expect the global production of passenger cars and \\nlight commercial vehicles weighing less than 6 metric tons to be \\nroughly on a par with the previous year and develop by -1% to 1% \\nin 2025.  \\nIn the first half of 2025, we expect a global production volume of \\naround 44 million units, which should improve slightly in the second \\nhalf of the year, particularly due to the momentum of the Chinese \\nmarket.  \\nHowever, this outlook is subject to uncertainty due to the tense  \\ngeopolitical situation and the uncertain development of demand, \\nparticularly in Europe. \\n \\n \\n \\nReport on Expected Developments  \\nFuture General Conditions  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Expected Developments \\n91\\nChanges to vehicle production, the tire-replacement business and industrial production in 2025 (compared with 2024) \\nPassenger cars and light \\ncommercial vehicles \\nVehicle production \\nTire-replacement \\nbusiness \\n  \\n  \\nIndustrial production \\nEurope \\n–5% to –3% \\n0% to 2%   Eurozone \\n–1% to 1% \\nNorth America \\n–3% to –1% \\n0% to 2%   USA \\n0% to 2% \\nChina \\n1% to 3% \\n1% to 3%   China \\n4% to 6% \\nWorldwide \\n–1% to 1% \\n0% to 2% \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\nMedium and heavy  \\ncommercial vehicles \\nVehicle production \\nTire-replacement \\nbusiness \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nEurope \\n2% to 4% \\n0% to 2%   \\n  \\n  \\nNorth America \\n–2% to 0% \\n–2% to 1%   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSources:  \\nVehicle production (Europe with Western, Central and Eastern Europe incl.

These in-\\nclude sales and the adjusted EBIT margin for the Continental Group \\nand for the Automotive, Tires, ContiTech and Contract Manufactur-\\ning group sectors. \\nIn addition, we provide information on the assessment of important \\nfactors influencing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). These in-\\nclude the expected development of special effects and the amount \\nof amortization from purchase price allocations. We thus allow the \\nContinental Group’s expected EBIT to be estimated.  \\nFurthermore, we give an assessment of the development of the  \\nfinancial result before effects from currency translation and before \\neffects from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, and \\nother valuation effects, as well as the tax rate for the Continental \\nGroup. This allows a reconciliation to expected net income. We also \\npublish a forecast of the capital expenditures planned for the cur-\\nrent year and the adjusted free cash flow. Our forecast is based on \\nour expectations regarding the most important production and \\nsales markets in the new fiscal year.  \\nWe publish our forecast as part of our annual press conference and \\nthe publication of our annual report. It is continually reviewed over \\nthe course of the fiscal year. Possible changes to the forecast are \\ndescribed at the latest in the report for the respective quarter.  \\nComparison of the past fiscal year against forecast \\nIn our forecast for fiscal 2024, which we published in March 2024, \\nwe expected the global production of passenger cars and light com-\\nmercial vehicles to be roughly on a par with the previous year, with \\na negative development expected in our core market of Europe. \\nThe outlook took into account the tense geopolitical situation and \\nits expected impact on production volumes in 2024. \\nHigher costs for wages and salaries – amounting to around €0.5 bil-\\nlion – were also expected to weigh heavily on our earnings position, \\nwith around half of these costs attributable to the Automotive \\ngroup sector. \\nBased on the above assumptions as well as on the exchange rates \\nat the beginning of the fiscal year, we expected the following key  \\nfinancial figures for fiscal 2024: \\n› We expected the Continental Group to achieve sales in the range \\nof around €41.0 billion to €44.0 billion and an adjusted EBIT mar-\\ngin of around 6.0% to 7.0%. \\n› We expected our Automotive group sector to achieve sales of \\naround €20.0 billion to €22.0 billion. We expected the adjusted \\nEBIT margin to be around 3.0% to 4.0%.  \\n› We expected our Tires group sector to achieve sales of around \\n€14.0 billion to €15.0 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin of \\naround 13.0% to 14.0%. \\n› We expected our ContiTech group sector to achieve sales of \\naround €6.6 billion to €7.0 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin  \\nof around 6.5% to 7.5%. \\n› In our Contract Manufacturing group sector, we anticipated sales \\nof around €200 million to €300 million and an adjusted EBIT \\nmargin of around 0%. \\n› Consolidated amortization from purchase price allocations was \\nexpected to be around €100 million and affect mainly the Auto-\\nmotive and ContiTech group sectors. \\n› In addition, we expected negative special effects of around \\n€450 million. \\n› In 2024, we expected the negative financial result to be around \\n€350 million before effects from currency translation, effects \\nfrom changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, and \\nother valuation effects. \\n› The tax rate was expected to be around 27%. \\n› The capital expenditure ratio was expected to be around 6.0% to \\n7.0% of sales in fiscal 2024.  \\n› In 2024, we were planning on adjusted free cash flow of approxi-\\nmately €0.7 billion to €1.1 billion. \\nThe outlook remained unchanged in the quarterly statement for \\nthe first quarter of 2024. \\nIn the half-year financial report, we adjusted our outlook for fiscal \\n2024 due to the following factors: \\n› We expected the global production of passenger cars and light \\ncommercial vehicles to decline by 1% to 3% year-on-year. \\nAssuming exchange rates would not change significantly as the \\nyear progressed, this meant that the following adjustments were \\nmade to the outlook for fiscal 2024: \\n› Consolidated sales were expected to be in the range of around \\n€40.0 billion to €42.5 billion, and the adjusted EBIT margin was \\nexpected to be around 6.0% to 7.0%. \\n› For the Automotive group sector, sales were expected to be \\naround €19.5 billion to €21.0 billion, with an adjusted EBIT  \\nmargin of around 2.5% to 3.5%. \\n› For the Tires group sector, sales were expected to be around \\n€13.5 billion to €14.5 billion, with an adjusted EBIT margin of \\naround 13.0% to 14.0%. \\n› We expected our ContiTech group sector to achieve sales of \\naround €6.6 billion to €7.0 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin  \\nof around 6.5% to 7.0%. \\n› We expected negative special effects of around €350 million. \\nOutlook for the Continental Group \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Expected Developments \\n93\\n› Adjusted free cash flow was expected to be around €0.6 billion to \\n€1.0 billion. \\nThe other parts of the outlook remained unchanged. \\nIn the quarterly statement for the third quarter of 2024, we ad-\\njusted the following estimate: \\n› We expected the industrial business worldwide to remain sluggish. \\nWith respect to the key financial figures, we made the following \\nchanges: \\n› Consolidated sales were expected to be in the range of around \\n€39.5 billion to €42.0 billion, and the adjusted EBIT margin was \\nexpected to be around 6.0% to 7.0%. \\n› We expected our ContiTech group sector to achieve sales of \\naround €6.2 billion to €6.6 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin  \\nof around 5.8% to 6.3%. \\n› The tax rate was expected to be around 30%. The higher calcu-\\nlated tax rate compared with the previous assumption was mainly \\ndue to the allocation of net income to the different countries in \\nrelation to comprehensive income. Tax charges that are not di-\\nrectly dependent on income also continued to have an effect. \\nThese include foreign (minimum) taxes with deviating bases of \\nassessment as well as foreign withholding taxes that are not de-\\nductible in Germany. Added to this were tax risks in connection \\nwith ongoing criminal tax investigations by Italian authorities. As \\na precautionary measure, provisions were set aside for likely  \\nfinancial charges in this regard. \\nAll other parts of the outlook remained unchanged. \\nOwing to our operating performance in the fourth quarter, we \\nachieved the following results for fiscal 2024: \\n› The Continental Group generated sales of €39.7 billion and an \\nadjusted EBIT margin of 6.8%. \\n› The Automotive group sector generated sales of €19.4 billion \\nand an adjusted EBIT margin of 2.3%. \\n› The Tires group sector generated sales of €13.9 billion and an  \\nadjusted EBIT margin of 13.7%. \\n› The ContiTech group sector generated sales of €6.4 billion and \\nan adjusted EBIT margin of 6.2%. \\n› The Contract Manufacturing group sector generated sales of \\n€0.2 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin of 2.9%. \\n› Total consolidated expense from special effects amounted to \\n€300 million in 2024. \\n› Amortization from purchase price allocations was €109 million. \\n› In the year under review, the negative financial result amounted \\nto €346 million before effects from currency translation and be-\\nfore effects from changes in the fair value of derivative instru-\\nments, and other valuation effects. \\n› Income tax expense for fiscal 2024 amounted to €689 million. \\nThe tax rate was 36.5%. \\n› The capital expenditure ratio was 5.5%. \\n› Adjusted free cash flow was €1,052 million in 2024 and therefore \\nslightly above our forecast range of €0.6 billion to €1.0 billion in \\nthe quarterly statement for the third quarter of 2024. \\nOrder situation \\nThe order situation in our Automotive group sector continues to  \\nbe characterized by weak production figures, delayed production \\nlaunches and the transformation of the automotive industry. In to-\\ntal, orders amounting to around €19 billion were acquired in fiscal \\n2024 (PY: €27 billion). This figure includes expected sales over the \\nentire duration of the delivery, known as lifetime sales. These are \\nbased primarily on assumptions regarding production volumes of \\nthe respective vehicle or engine platforms, the expected and \\nagreed cost adjustments, and the development of key raw material \\nprices. \\nThe replacement-tire business accounts for a large portion of the \\nTires group sector’s sales, which is why it is not possible to calcu-\\nlate a reliable figure for order volumes.  \\nThe same applies to the ContiTech group sector, which has busi-\\nness areas operating in various markets and industrial sectors, \\neach in turn with their own relevant factors. Consolidating the or-\\nder figures from the various business areas of the ContiTech group \\nsector would thus be meaningful only to a limited extent. \\nOutlook for fiscal 2025 \\nAs mentioned on page 90 of the report on expected developments, \\nwe expect the global production of passenger cars and light com-\\nmercial vehicles in 2025 to be roughly on a par with the previous \\nyear, with a negative development expected in our core markets of \\nEurope and North America. \\nThis outlook takes into account the current tense geopolitical situa-\\ntion and its expected impact on production volumes in 2025. It \\ndoes not take into account potential significant changes to global \\ntariffs, however. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Expected Developments \\n94\\nComparison of forecasts for the group sectors of Continental for fiscal 2024 \\n \\nAutomotive \\nTires \\nContiTech \\nContract Manufacturing \\n \\nSales \\n(€ billions) \\nAdjusted \\nEBIT margin \\n(%) \\nSales \\n(€ billions) \\nAdjusted \\nEBIT margin \\n(%) \\nSales \\n(€ billions) \\nAdjusted \\nEBIT margin \\n(%) \\nSales \\n(€ billions) \\nAdjusted \\nEBIT margin \\n(%) \\nAnnual press conference \\non March 7, 2024 \\n~ 20.0 – 22.0 \\n~ 3.0 – 4.0 \\n~ 14.0 – 15.0 \\n~ 13.0 – 14.0 \\n~ 6.6 – 7.0 \\n~ 6.5 – 7.5 \\n~ 0.2 – 0.3 \\n~ 0 \\nHalf-year financial report  \\nas at August 7, 2024 \\n~ 19.5 – 21.0 \\n~ 2.5 – 3.5 \\n~ 13.5 – 14.5 \\n~ 13.0 – 14.0 \\n~ 6.6 – 7.0 \\n~ 6.5 – 7.0 \\n~ 0.2 – 0.3 \\n~ 0 \\nQuarterly statement \\nas at November 11, 2024 \\n~ 19.5 – 21.0 \\n~ 2.5 – 3.5 \\n~ 13.5 – 14.5 \\n~ 13.0 – 14.0 \\n~ 6.2 – 6.6 \\n~ 5.8 – 6.3 \\n~ 0.2 – 0.3 \\n~ 0 \\n2024 annual report \\n19.4 \\n2.3 \\n13.9 \\n13.7 \\n6.4 \\n6.2 \\n0.2 \\n2.9 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nComparison of key forecast elements for the Continental Group for fiscal 2024 \\n \\nContinental Group \\n \\nSales \\n(€ billions) \\nAdjusted \\nEBIT margin \\n(%) \\nSpecial effects \\n(€ billions) \\nInvestments \\n(in % of \\nsales) \\nAdjusted  \\nfree cash flow \\n(€ billions) \\nAnnual press conference \\non March 7, 2024 \\n~ 41.0 – 44.0 \\n~ 6.0 – 7.0 \\n~ –0.45 \\n~ 6.0 – 7.0 \\n~ 0.7 – 1.1 \\nHalf-year financial report  \\nas at August 7, 2024 \\n~ 40.0 – 42.5 \\n~ 6.0 – 7.0 \\n~ –0.35 \\n~ 6.0 – 7.0 \\n~ 0.6 – 1.0 \\nQuarterly statement \\nas at November 11, 2024 \\n~ 39.5 – 42.0 \\n~ 6.0 – 7.0 \\n~ –0.35 \\n~ 6.0 – 7.0 \\n~ 0.6 – 1.0 \\n2024 annual report \\n39.7 \\n6.8 \\n–0.30 \\n5.5 \\n1.1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAll figures take into account the exceptions and definitions specified in each case in the comparison against forecast. \\nBased on the above assumptions as well as on the exchange rates \\nat the beginning of the fiscal year, we expect the following key  \\nfinancial figures for fiscal 2025: \\n› We expect the Continental Group to achieve sales in the range of \\naround €38.0 billion to €41.0 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin \\nof around 6.5% to 7.5%. \\n› We expect our Automotive group sector to achieve sales of around \\n€18.0 billion to €20.0 billion.

This sustainability report also contains the \\ncombined non-financial statement in accordance with Sections \\n289b to 289e and 315b to 315c of the German Commercial Code \\n(Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB) for the Continental Group and Conti-\\nnental AG, for fiscal 2024. \\nThis sustainability report contains the information to be disclosed \\nfor fiscal 2024 in accordance with Art. 8 of EU Taxonomy Regula-\\ntion (EU) 2020/852 in conjunction with Art. 10 (2) of Delegated \\nRegulation (EU) 2021/2178 of the Commission. \\nThis sustainability report was subject to a limited assurance by the \\nindependent auditor. The auditor’s report of the sustainability report \\ncan be found on page 220 ff. of this annual report. \\nCombined Non-Financial Statement \\nDue to the legal uncertainties arising from the lack of implementa-\\ntion of the CSRD into German law at the time of reporting, the Ex-\\necutive Board of Continental AG, in coordination with the Supervi-\\nsory Board, has decided to fully apply, for the first time, the ESRS  \\nresulting from the CSRD as a framework in accordance with Sec-\\ntion 315c (3) in conjunction with Section 289d HGB for preparing \\nthe combined non-financial statement in accordance with Sections \\n315b and 315c in conjunction with Sections 289b to 289e HGB. \\nThe information for Continental AG pursuant to Sections 289b to \\n289e HGB is thus also fulfilled. For Continental AG as the parent \\ncompany of the Continental Group, no separate framework in ac-\\ncordance with Section 289d HGB was used, as the approaches, re-\\nsults, targets, performance indicators and risks reported for the \\nContinental Group also apply equally to the parent company. There-\\nfore, no further information beyond that reported for the Continental \\nGroup is required. Accordingly, Continental does not consider the use \\nof a framework for the parent company to be useful. \\nContinental points out general uncertainties with regard to interpre-\\ntation issues in the use of the ESRS as a framework for non-finan-\\ncial statements. \\nThe following information refers to the respective sections and sub-\\nsections of the sustainability report and the management report in \\ngeneral, in which the information for the combined non-financial \\nstatement as required by HGB can be found. \\nA description of the Continental Group’s business models can be \\nfound in the General disclosures (ESRS 2) section of this sustaina-\\nbility report in the subsection Strategy, business model and value \\nchain and in the Corporate profile section of the management re-\\nport under Structure of the Continental Group. \\n \\nEnvironmental matters \\nThe approaches pursued by Continental with regard to environ-\\nmental matters are described in the management approaches as \\nfollows: \\n› Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, Scope 3 emissions, portfolio re-\\nsilience and transition, Climate change adaptation, Supply chain \\nresilience and transition in the Climate change (ESRS E1) section, \\n› Environmental protection in own operations, Environmental pro-\\ntection in the supply chain, Product-related aspects regarding en-\\nvironmental protection and Substances of concern and very high \\nconcern in the Pollution (ESRS E2) section, \\n› Responsible purchasing and upstream value chain and Down-\\nstream value chain in the Biodiversity and ecosystems (ESRS E4) \\nsection, and \\n› Circularity and waste in own operations in the Resource use and \\ncircular economy (ESRS E5) section. \\nThe results of the approaches pursued in relation to environmental \\nmatters are described as part of the impacts, risks and opportuni-\\nties as well as the metrics in the sections on Climate change (ESRS \\nE1), Pollution (ESRS E2), Biodiversity and ecosystems (ESRS E4) \\nand Resource use and circular economy (ESRS E5). \\nEmployee matters \\nThe approaches pursued by Continental with regard to employee \\nmatters are described in the management

pursued by Continental with regard to anti-corrup-\\ntion and anti-bribery matters is described in the management ap-\\nproaches in the Business conduct and corporate governance (ESRS \\nG1) section. \\nThe results of the approach pursued with regard to anti-corruption \\nand anti-bribery matters are described as part of the impacts and \\nrisks as well as metrics in the Business conduct and

manage-\\nment report. Beyond this scope, no additional non-financial risks \\nwere identified in accordance with Section 289c (3) HGB. The risks \\nand opportunities described in the topic-related sections of the sus-\\ntainability report are based on the application of the ESRS frame-\\nwork and the definition of double materiality anchored therein, and \\ntherefore explicitly go beyond the definition in the HGB. \\nPerformance indicators \\nNon-financial and sustainability-related performance indicators in \\naccordance with HGB are defined as part of the key performance \\ncriteria in the remuneration system in the Corporate profile section \\nof the management report under Sustainability management. \\nThese do not constitute the most significant non-financial perfor-\\nmance indicators within the meaning of Section 289c (3) HGB. The \\nmost significant key performance indicators for the Continental \\nGroup consist exclusively of financial indicators, and can be found \\nin the Corporate management and Outlook for the Continental \\nGroup sections of this management report. \\nCorrelations with the consolidated financial statement \\nWhere necessary for an understanding of the context, reference is \\nmade in this sustainability report to the figures and additional ex-\\nplanations provided in the consolidated financial statements. \\n \\n', ' \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report \\n97\\nNotes on Applying the ESRS \\nGeneral basis for preparation of the sustainability report  \\nThis report was prepared in accordance with the European Sustain-\\nability Reporting Standards (ESRS). \\nFor the preparation of this report and based on the set of required \\nformal and content requirements, subject matter experts were iden-\\ntified for quantitative disclosures and qualitative disclosures. The \\ncontent of the sustainability report was prepared by the relevant \\nsubject matter experts and then consolidated and reviewed by the \\nGroup Sustainability group function. The report was formally ap-\\nproved as part of the overall financial reporting process. Opera-\\ntional supervision is exercised by the Sustainability Steering Com-\\nmittee, of which also the Executive Board of the Continental Group \\nis a member. Sustainability reporting also falls under the supervi-\\nsion of the Supervisory Board. Further information on supervision \\ncan be found in the subsection Consideration of sustainability mat-\\nters in corporate supervision. \\nThe reported metrics are based on specific definitions, assump-\\ntions, and calculations methods. These are presented directly in \\nconjunction with the respective metrics, if relevant. In this regard, it \\nshould be noted that especially modelled metrics are subject to un-\\ncertainty.  \\nThe statement in accordance with ESRS 2.77 that metrics are not \\nsubject to validation by an external body other than the independ-\\nent auditor has not been repeated for each individual metric, as \\nthis applies to every metric. \\nWhen applying the ESRS, the terminology of the ESRS is used as a \\ngeneral rule while also taking into account terminology compre-\\nhensibility and consistency within the management report as well \\nas any existing and potential further adjustments to the ESRS. For \\nexample, the terms used include management approach instead of \\npolicy, and key actions for target achievement instead of actions \\nand resources as well as Business Conduct and Corporate Govern-\\nance instead of only Business Conduct (as section headline). \\nContinental furthermore points out some general uncertainties \\nwith regard to the first time application of the ESRS.  \\nScope of Consolidation \\nThe sustainability report has been created on a consolidated basis \\nfor the entire Continental Group. \\nIn principle, Continental applies the same scope of consolidation \\nfor this report as for the consolidated financial statements. This sus-\\ntainability report therefore covers Continental AG and all its subsidi-\\naries (collectively referred to as Continental or the Continental \\nGroup).  \\nAll disclosures in this report relate to the fiscal year from January 1 \\nto December 31, 2024. Where relevant, information up until the ac-\\ntual publication of this report has been considered. \\nAn overview of the relevant data points that derive from other Eu-\\nropean legislation and where they can be found in this sustainabil-\\nity report has been included in the Overviews and indexes in ac-\\ncordance with ESRS 2 section.  \\nUpstream and downstream value chain \\nContinental’s upstream and downstream value chains have been in-\\ncluded in the preparation of the sustainability report and the as-\\nsessment of impacts, risks and opportunities. This includes in par-\\nticular the consideration of supply chains (see for example impact \\n18) or the product use phase (see for example 19). The impacts, \\nrisks and opportunities material for Continental that follow the ma-\\nteriality analysis in relation to the value chain are presented in the \\nDetails of the material impacts, risks and opportunities subsection \\nand described in the topic-related subsections, including the re-\\nspective management approaches. \\nOmissions \\nContinental has not omitted a specific piece of information relating \\nto intellectual property, know-how or the results of innovation.  \\nContinental has not made use of the exemption provided for in Ar-\\nticle 19a (3) and Article 29a (3) of Directive 2013/34/EU and Sec-\\ntion 289e HGB for the disclosure of imminent developments or \\nmatters under negotiation. \\nDisclosures due to other legislation on sustainability reporting \\nThis sustainability report constitutes, at the same time, the com-\\nbined non-financial statement in accordance with Sections 289b to \\n289e and 315b and 315c in conjunction with Sections 289b to \\n289e HGB, for the Continental Group and Continental AG, for fiscal \\n2024.

The methodology of the assessment is further \\ndescribed in the Process for identifying and assessing material IRO \\nsubsection. \\n \\nThe integration of impacts, risks and opportunities into the strategy \\nand the business model is carried out in accordance with the con-\\ntrol processes and management approaches described in the  \\nGovernance subsection of this section and in the respective topic-\\nrelated sections. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report \\n99\\nProcess for Identifying and Assessing Material IROs \\nDescription of methodology and assumptions \\nContinental assesses its impacts, risks and opportunities according \\nto the ESRS methodology requirements on double materiality (IRO \\nassessment). Continental’s 2024 IRO assessment has been conduc- \\nted simultaneously with both impact materiality (inside-out) and  \\nfinancial materiality (outside-in) perspectives. \\n \\nIdentification and creation of the longlist of IROs \\nThe list of sustainability matters of the ESRS 1.AR16 formed the \\nstarting point of the identification of impacts, risks and opportuni-\\nties. In addition for risks and opportunities, certain event types (e.g. \\nfines, loss of sales or growth of sales) were considered. These initial \\nscenarios and descriptions of IROs have been identified at topic, \\nsub-topic or sub-sub-topic level and have been aggregated when-\\never it was relevant and appropriate considering Continental’s busi-\\nness activities, value chain, geographical location, industries, and \\nbusiness models. Company-specific aspects were also considered, \\nall of which could be assigned to the predefined list of sustainability \\nmatters. These scenarios specify the matters further for Conti-\\nnental’s value chain and were partially split into individual scenarios \\nfor own operations, upstream and/or downstream value chain, \\nwhenever relevant. \\nInitial gross assessment  \\nIn an initial step, the IRO scenarios were centrally assessed from a \\ngross perspective. The gross perspective assesses impacts, risks \\nand opportunities in a scenario that does not yet consider the exist-\\ning management approaches of Continental, as described in the re-\\nspective topic-related sections. This initial gross assessment com- \\nprised various assessments of the severity and magnitude of the \\neffect as well as the likelihood. This assessment was based on the \\njudgement and sustainability expertise of subject matter experts at \\nGroup level. \\nValidation and assessment  \\nIn a second step, the longlist of IRO scenarios was assessed from \\nthe perspectives of relevant stakeholders. In multiple workshops, \\ndifferent functions of Continental acted as proxies of internal and \\nexternal affected stakeholders, subject matter experts and/or users \\nof sustainability information. The participants of the workshops re-\\nceived the longlist and further information on the methodology in \\nadvance of the workshops and were trained in the methodology \\nduring the workshops. \\nEach workshop included a validation, update and/or extension of \\nthe longlist. The IRO scenarios were then defined in greater detail, \\nthe gross assessment was validated or updated as appropriate, fur-\\nther information was collected and an initial net assessment was \\nmade. The net assessment considers the management approaches \\nof Continental, as described in the respective topic-related sections. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report \\n100\\nThe assessments in the workshops also took the following into ac-\\ncount: \\n› Dependencies on the availability of natural, human, and social re-\\nsources at appropriate prices and in adequate quality, independ-\\nent of the potential impacts on those resources \\n› A primarily relevant time horizon for the definition of IRO scenar-\\nios and potential consequences \\n› Sectors and/or geographical locations where relevant \\n› External studies and other scientific evidence \\n› External data (e.g. country risk analyses and industry risk anal-\\nyses) \\n› Specific data for Continental or Continental’s value chain (e.g. \\nScope 3 greenhouse gas emissions) \\nConsolidation  \\nIn an iterative approach based on the assessments during the \\nworkshops, an initial consolidation has been prepared by Group \\nSustainability in close coordination with Group Risk Management. \\nThe consolidation was completed especially based on the out-\\ncomes of all individual workshops as well as cross-checks with \\nContinental’s general risk assessment.  \\nThe materiality threshold has been set after the consolidation of \\nIRO assessments. The materiality of negative impacts and risks was \\nassessed based on the gross perspective to consider where it is rel-\\nevant to have adequate management approaches and report on \\nthem. The materiality of positive impacts as well as of opportunities \\nwas assessed based on the net perspective to consider where ex-\\nisting management approaches can contribute to these impacts \\nand opportunities. From an overarching perspective, the materiality \\nthreshold for the gross assessment of the severity of negative im-\\npacts and risks and for the net assessment of the magnitude of the \\neffect of positive impacts and opportunities was set at high and \\nvery high ratings (see the scales used under Impact materiality and \\nfinancial materiality). Regarding the likelihood of occurrence, no \\nthreshold was applied. In cases where an IRO was flagged as a fo-\\ncus topic for the relevant users of Continental’s sustainability infor-\\nmation, this IRO has also been evaluated as material and included \\nin the reporting. \\nRevalidation and formal confirmation \\nAs part of the iterative approach and until finalization of the report, \\nthe assessment was validated and updated where required, based \\non relevant new knowledge or relevant new developments and \\nevents. The re-validated assessment was formally confirmed by \\nContinental’s Sustainability Steering Committee. \\nIn conclusion, Continental has identified more than 150 IROs and \\nevaluated 75 as material. More details on the individual material \\nIROs can be found under the individual topic-related sections in the \\nMaterial impacts, risks and opportunities subsections. \\nIn the IRO assessment, Continental incorporated a set of methodolo-\\ngies and assumptions that reflect both current and projected devel-\\nopments on the basis of profound expert judgment. The main as-\\nsumptions on which the IRO assessment was based are as follows: \\n› Continental assumed that environmental factors and social influ-\\nence will have a general growing impact on business activities, \\nsupply chains, and market conditions regarding for example the \\nfuture availability of resources, the environmental transition and \\nsocio-economic trends. \\n› The financial assessment is based on assumptions regarding fu-\\nture regulatory developments, market trends and technological \\nadvancements, among other things. The likely consequences of \\nthese regulatory changes were taken into account. Moreover, \\nContinental assumes that technology will continue to advance \\nand support sustainability initiatives. This includes assumptions \\nabout the development and introduction of green technologies. \\n› The assessment of the impacts, risks and opportunities related to \\nContinental’s value chain takes into account, in particular, the spe-\\ncific features of the respective geographical regions, industries, \\nbusiness activities and types of operation. \\nContinental’s due diligence processes play a key role in identifying, \\nassessing, and managing impacts, risks and opportunities. They are \\npart of the management processes described in this section under \\nGovernance as well as in the management approaches in the topic-\\nrelated sections. The assessment of impacts regarding human \\nrights is supported by the due diligence processes of Continental’s \\nResponsible Value Chain Due Diligence System (RVCDDS), e.g. re-\\ngarding actual impacts by incidents or the assessment of potential \\nnegative impacts (see especially the topic-related Own workforce \\n(ESRS S1) section and Workers in the value chain (ESRS S2) section).  \\nWhere specific activities, business relationships, geographical loca-\\ntions or other factors lead to a higher assessment of the impacts, \\nthis was essentially taken into account in the description and as-\\nsessment of the IROs.  \\nThrough the holistic approach of the IRO assessment, the impacts \\nhave been assessed within Continental’s own operations and in the \\nupstream and/or downstream value chain. The relevant stage of \\nthe value chain is described in the respective impacts, risks and op-\\nportunities. \\nAs described in the methodology, affected stakeholders were in-\\nvolved in the assessment process by subject matters experts who \\nacted as internal proxies. The stakeholders’ views are incorporated \\ninto the respective management approaches as described in the \\ntopic-related sections and thus also contribute to the evaluations \\nby the subject matter experts who were involved in the assessment \\nof the IROs. \\n', ' \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report \\n101\\nImpact materiality \\nThe impact materiality is based on the severity or magnitude of the \\neffect of the impact. In the case of potential impacts, the probability \\nwas also assessed, but not taken into account in the evaluation of \\nmateriality. A five-point scale from “very low” to “very high” was \\nused for both aspects.  \\nThe assessment of the severity or magnitude of the effect is based \\non the following factors: \\n› the scale, \\n› the scope, and \\n› for negative impacts, also the irremediable character of the im-\\npact. \\nThe threshold for material impacts follows the general described \\nmethodology for thresholds, as laid out in this subsection under \\nConsolidation. \\nFinancial materiality \\nThe integrated approach of the IRO assessment allows Continental \\nto assess risks and opportunities together with the topically related \\nimpacts in a combined view. Thereby it was possible to consider in-\\nterdependencies between risks and opportunities with impacts. In \\nthe topic-related sections, the detailed descriptions of impacts, risks \\nand opportunities are grouped into related IRO clusters (e.g. all \\nIROs on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in one IRO cluster). \\nAlso risks and opportunities were assessed according to the level of \\nseverity effect and magnitude of financial impacts and the likeli-\\nhood of occurrence in the short-, medium-, or long-term. The finan-\\ncial impacts were assessed using semi-quantitative guidelines that \\nwere defined in consultation with Group Risk Management. Five \\nlevels from “very low” to “very high” were used as the rating scale. \\nThe financial impacts considered include effects on Continental’s fi-\\nnancial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to financ-\\ning, cost of capital and financial outlook. The threshold for financial \\nmateriality follows the general described methodology for thresh-\\nolds, as laid out in this subsection under Consolidation. \\nGroup Risk Management was closely involved in all steps of the IRO \\nassessment. Before the results were provisionally confirmed, they \\nwere iteratively compared with the company’s risk inventory to en-\\nsure complete consistency. Further details on the alignment are de-\\nscribed in the subsection Integration of IROs in risk management. \\nThe Sustainability Steering Committee was involved in milestones \\nof the IRO assessment, acted as a supervisory body and formally \\nconfirmed the results. In addition, the Group’s Governance, Risk and \\nCompliance (GRC) Committee in particular, which manages general \\nrisk management, was indirectly involved in the process and was \\ninformed in particular about the IRO assessment and the interrela-\\ntions with risk management. \\nIntegration of IROs in risk management \\nThe IRO assessment has taken into account both the assessments \\nbased on the ESRS requirements and the assessments as part of \\nenterprise risk management in accordance with the relevant re-\\nquirements. To this end, the IRO assessment is continuously coordi-\\nnated with general risk management.  \\nIn view of the major differences in the required methods, con-\\nsistency checks were carried out. The sustainability-related risks \\ncompatible with the methodology relevant for enterprise risk man-\\nagement have been aligned with the risks documented in the gen-\\neral risk assessment reporting system. Impacts not directly related \\nto an identified risk were not considered in the enterprise risk man-\\nagement. \\nFurther information on risk management can be found in the man-\\nagement report in the Main characteristics of the risk management \\nsystem subsection in the subsection on Continental’s internal con-\\ntrol and risk management system in the Report on risks and oppor-\\ntunities section. \\nThe outcome of the IRO assessment confirmed the topic-related fo-\\ncus of Continental’s Sustainability Ambition anchored in Conti-\\nnental’s strategy. The concrete effects of impacts, risks and oppor-\\ntunities on Continental’s business model, value chain, strategy and \\ndecision-making as well as how Continental responds and plans to \\nrespond to these effects are addressed in more detail in the de-\\nscriptions of the IROs and management approaches in the respec-\\ntive topic-related section. \\n \\n \\n', \" \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report \\n102\\nStakeholders and Stakeholder Engagement \\nContinental maintains regular, ongoing dialogue with various stake-\\nholders via diverse channels. \\nFor Continental, the most important stakeholders with regard to \\nsustainability include in particular: \\n› Employees and their representatives, \\n› Customers, consumers, and end-users, \\n› Capital market participants, \\n› Policymakers, \\n› Affected communities and civil society, \\n› Actors within Continental’s supply chain, and \\n› Users of Continental’s sustainability reporting. \\nStakeholders are involved via the following channels:  \\n› Employees and their representatives: e.g. via works meetings, em-\\nployee surveys, webcasts, meetings with employee representa-\\ntives and directly via the HR departments, \\n› Customers, consumers and end-users: e.g. via sales departments \\nor key account management, partnerships, trade fairs, surveys \\nand customer service centers, \\n› Capital market participants: e.g. via the Annual Shareholders’ \\nMeeting, webcasts and roadshows, \\n› Public policymakers: e.g. via public affairs departments, \\n› Affected communities and civil society: e.g. via engagement pro-\\njects and open house events, \\n› Actors within Continental's supply chain: e.g. via the purchasing \\ndepartments and trade fairs, and \\n› Users of sustainability reporting: e.g. via published sustainability \\nreporting. \\nThe formats used to involve stakeholders differ depending on the \\nstakeholder group and are organized by the respective functions to \\nsuit the individual purpose. For example, employees are involved by \\nthe HR departments. \\nThe aim of involving the stakeholders is to bring together different \\nperspectives, discuss any discrepancies in views and learn from \\neach other. \\nThe results of stakeholder engagement in various formats, along \\nwith further analyses and new ideas, are continuously being incor-\\nporated into the process of further developing our sustainability \\nstrategy and reporting. In particular, the results of stakeholder en-\\ngagement are taken into account in the decision-making process \\nthrough the management approaches described in the topic-re-\\nlated sections. \\nIn the IRO assessment, an expanded understanding was created for \\nthe perspective (including interests and views) of the affected \\nstakeholders as described in the Consideration of stakeholder inter-\\nests and views subsection. \\nConsideration of stakeholder interests and views \\nIn general, the views of stakeholders serve as an information basis \\nfor the management approaches that are relevant to sustainability \\nand those that are described in the topic-related sections. At the \\nsame time, these management approaches in turn create an infor-\\nmation basis for the overarching strategy processes with regard to \\nstakeholder views. The described management approaches, market \\nrequirements, trends and other factors are taken into account as \\npart of the overarching strategy processes. When changing strat-\\negy, the interests and views of stakeholders are therefore mainly in-\\ncluded indirectly as one of many factors. Continental did not \\nchange its strategy or business models on the basis of the IRO  \\nassessment. \\nContinental amends the strategy and the business models as part \\nof the annual strategy processes and the continuous strategic dia-\\nlogue in all group sectors as well as part of the topic-related man-\\nagement approaches. \\nContinental assumes that any changes to strategy or business \\nmodel has impacts on the relationship with stakeholders and the \\nstakeholders’ views – no matter whether they are based on sustain-\\nability-related decision-making or other reasoning. Continuous vali-\\ndation of the views of stakeholders is therefore relevant for the \\nevaluation of impacts, risks and opportunities as well as subse-\\nquent strategic decision-making. Further information on this strat-\\negy can be found in this management report in the Corporate pro-\\nfile section under the subsection Strategy of the Continental Group. \\nThe identification of opportunities and, in particular, the identifica-\\ntion of strategic opportunities as part of the IRO assessment was \\nalso linked to strategy processes. \\nThe views and interests of affected stakeholders with regard to the \\ncompany’s sustainability-related impacts have been considered in \\nthe IRO assessment. The IRO assessment considering these views \\nwas discussed in the Sustainability Steering Committee as well as in \\nthe Supervisory Board’s Sustainability Working Group. \\n \\n \\n\", \" \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report \\n103\\nInterests and views of stakeholders relating to own workforce \\nThe interests, views, and rights of Continentals workforce, including \\nthe respect for their human rights, are integral to shaping Conti-\\nnental's strategy and business model. To ensure that their perspec-\\ntives are incorporated into strategic decisions, Continental is in reg-\\nular contact with employees and their representatives via various \\nchannels, such as works councils and co-determination in the Su-\\npervisory Board. Further information on the involvement of em-\\nployees and their perspectives in the overall business processes \\ncan be found in the Own workforce (ESRS S1) section. Furthermore, \\nthe inclusion of the own workforce is described in the methodology \\nof the IRO assessment. \\nInterests and views of stakeholders relating to workers in the \\nvalue chain \\nThe interests, views, and rights of workers in Continentals value \\nchain, including the respect for their human rights, inform Conti-\\nnental's related management approaches regarding a responsible \\nvalue chain. The involvement of the workers in the value chain is \\nalso described in more detail in the methodology of the IRO as-\\nsessment. \\nInterests and views of stakeholders relating to affected \\ncommunities \\nThe interests, views, and rights of affected communities, including \\nthe respect for their human rights inform Continental's related man-\\nagement approaches regarding a responsible value chain. The in-\\nvolvement of the affected communities is also described in more \\ndetail in the methodology of the IRO assessment.  \\nInterests and views of stakeholders relating to consumers and \\nend-users \\nThe interests, views, and rights of consumers and end-users, includ-\\ning the respect for their human rights, are part of Continental's strat-\\negy and business model. Where Continental is a supplier, such as for \\nautomotive components, the perspective of consumers and end-us-\\ners is seen as an integral part of the general feedback from custom-\\ners, such as car manufacturers. Where Continental directly sells end-\\nconsumer products, feedback from consumers and end-users and \\ntheir representatives is gathered through various channels, espe-\\ncially via customer service centers. In addition, Continental’s Mobility \\nStudy informs about the perspectives of end-users in major markets.  \\nThe involvement of consumers and end-users is also described in \\nmore detail in the methodology of the IRO assessment.  \\n \\n \\n \\n\", ' \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report \\n104\\nIdentification of the Information to Be Disclosed Based on the IRO Assessment \\nAs part of the IRO assessment, Continental has allocated the identi-\\nfied material impacts, risks and opportunities to the corresponding \\nESRS sustainability matters. This sustainability report only contains \\ninformation on the sustainability matters respectively topics, sub-\\ntopics and sub-sub-topics that have been classified as material, i.e. \\nat least one material impact, material risk or material opportunity \\nhas been identified for the respective sustainability matter. The im-\\nplementation guidelines provided by EFRAG were used as an addi-\\ntional source for the allocation of disclosure requirements for sus-\\ntainability matters. The identified material impacts, risks and oppor-\\ntunities with their specific descriptions set the focus within the re-\\nquired disclosures, for example on own operations, the supply \\nchain or specific product groups. The perspective of the primary \\nusers of financial reporting and other users of sustainability report-\\ning was already taken into account in the IRO assessment. \\nWhere relevant for the understanding of specifics identified by \\nContinental, adequate and meaningful entity-specific disclosures \\nwere added to provide sufficient granularity of information, such as \\nadditional metrics used in management processes. \\nThe principle of materiality of information was applied in order to \\ncalibrate the depth of the information and to omit individual disclo-\\nsures where these are not material for an understanding of the ma-\\nterial impacts, risks and opportunities and for the management ap-\\nproaches described, and are not necessary in order to fulfill the ob-\\njectives of the corresponding disclosure requirements. \\nIn addition, use was made of the simplification of the phase-in dis-\\nclosure requirements in accordance with ESRS 1.132. Continental \\nis working on being able to report these phase-in disclosure re-\\nquirements in accordance with the specified time horizons. \\nAn overview table of the reported disclosure requirements can be \\nfound at the end of the sustainability report in the Overviews and \\nindices in accordance with ESRS 2 section. \\n \\nDetails of the Material Impacts, Risks and Opportunities \\nThe actual and potential negative and positive impacts on people \\nand the environment are described in more detail within the re-\\nspective topic-related sections in the detailed descriptions of the \\nconcrete impacts. \\nMany of the impacts identified are inherent to the industry and are \\ndirectly related to specific types of business, products, value chains \\nor geographical regions. They can therefore be seen as impacts di-\\nrectly linked to Continental’s strategy and business models. Where \\napplicable, this is also addressed in the concrete descriptions of im-\\npacts within the topic-related section. \\nAs described in the methodology of the IRO assessment, Conti-\\nnental used a variety of input parameters to evaluate the IROs, in-\\ncluding both quantitative and qualitative data sources such as met-\\nrics, internal reports, and external market research.  \\nContinental has defined the following time intervals for potential \\nimpacts, risks and opportunities following the ESRS requirements: \\n› “Short-term” is coherent with the reporting period in the consoli-\\ndated financial statements (up to one year). \\n› “Medium-term” corresponds to a period between the end of the \\nshort- period and up to five years. \\n› “Long-term” is defined by a period of more than five years. \\nContinental considers the primary time horizons to be those in \\nwhich the strongest impacts or effects are to be expected.  \\nDepending on the topic, material impacts originate from own oper-\\nations or from business relationships. This information can be \\nfound in the respective topic-related sections in the subsections un-\\nder Material impacts, risks and opportunities and, in general, in this \\nsection under the Strategy, business model and value chain sub-\\nsection. \\nThe current financial effects of the identified material risks and op-\\nportunities relating to sustainability aspects include according to \\nContinental’s view, in particular, provisions for specific risks associ-\\nated with the identified IROs. In particular, these are provisions for \\nwarranties (see risk 70 in the Consumers and end-users (ESRS S4) \\nsection), which amounted to a total of €388 million as at Decem-\\nber 31, 2024. In addition, smaller parts of the provisions for litiga-\\ntion and environmental risks are linked to the risks, but mainly to \\nthe impacts from the Pollution (ESRS E2) section. Provisions for liti-\\ngation and environmental risks amounted to €297 million as at De-\\ncember 31, 2024. Provisions for restructuring are only indirectly \\nlinked to the identified material risks and opportunities described in \\nthe Own workforce (ESRS S1) section and therefore, from Conti-\\nnental’s perspective, do not represent current financial effects \\nwithin the definitions of the ESRS. \\n', ' \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report \\n105\\nFurthermore, no significant current financial effects on the recover-\\nability of non-financial assets and inventories were identified in con-\\nnection with identified sustainability-related and, in particular, cli-\\nmate-related risks. \\nIt should be noted that current financial effects in connection with \\nidentified material risks and opportunities relating to sustainability \\naspects are generally not independent of other associated effects. \\nFurther information is provided in the explanations of the relevant \\nnotes to the consolidated financial statements, for example in Note \\n29 relating to warranties. Further information on the fundamental \\nconsideration of sustainability-related aspects in accounting are de-\\nscribed in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial state-\\nments, particularly with regard to climate-related aspects in the \\nsubsection Impact of the macroeconomic environment and cli-\\nmate-related aspects on accounting in the reporting period.  \\nBased on the IRO assessment, taking into account the associated \\nlimitations and assumptions as set out in the subsection Process \\nfor identifying and assessing material IROs and taking into account \\nthe management approaches, targets and key actions for achieving \\nthe targets reported in the topic-related sections, Continental con-\\nsiders its business model and strategy to be resilient. The manage-\\nment approaches, targets and key actions for achieving the targets \\ndescribe Continental’s current ability to reduce its material negative \\nimpacts, increase positive impacts, manage risks, and seize oppor-\\ntunities. Continental also assumes that these skills will continue to \\ndevelop over time. \\nFurther information on risk management can be found in the man-\\nagement report under Main characteristics of the risk management \\nsystem in the subsection on Continental’s internal control and risk \\nmanagement system in the Report on risks and opportunities section. \\nThe identified impacts, risks and opportunities relate to at least one \\nsustainability matter as defined by the ESRS. The entity-specific dis-\\nclosure only provides additional granularity but does not contain \\nany new sustainability matters beyond the list of sustainability mat-\\nters in ESRS 1.AR16. The relation between entity-specific disclo-\\nsures and specific impacts, risks and opportunities are included in \\nthe description of the respective management approaches which \\nfollow the same clustering as the impacts, risks, and opportunities \\n(IRO cluster). \\nAs the reporting year 2024 constitutes the first year of reporting \\non the outcomes of an IRO assessment, there are no outcomes \\nfrom prior years for comparative analysis. \\nContinental identified 75 IROs that have been evaluated as material \\naccording to the IRO assessment methodology applied by Conti-\\nnental. Material IROs have been identified along the supply chain, \\nown operations, and downstream value chain. Given the different \\nfocus of topic-related sections, the distribution of the IROs along \\nthe value chain differs (e.g. the Own workforce (ESRS S1) section is, \\nby definition, focused specifically on own operations). \\nEach material IRO is described in more detail in the respective sub-\\nsections (Material impacts, risks and opportunities) of the topic-re-\\nlated section in this

robustness of the results, Its \\nIRO assessment for each topic-related section was performed fol-\\nlowing the principles and methodologies as described above. Fur-\\nthermore, additional factors were taken into account for individual \\nstandards in accordance with the ESRS.  \\nSpecifics of the IRO assessment in relation to climate change \\nThe negative impacts related to climate change were evaluated \\nbased on the reported GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) and the \\npositive impact with the interest on the evolution of the market \\ntrend toward low carbon vehicles. Regarding risks and opportuni-\\nties, specific risk and opportunity scenarios have been developed \\nand evaluated as part of the IRO assessment which are defined in \\nthe Description of methodology and assumptions subsection. The \\nconcrete scenarios are reflected in the descriptions of the respec-\\ntive IROs in the Climate change (ESRS E1) section. These include \\nextreme scenarios with low emissions for transition risks (see risks \\n13, 14 and 15) in which a 1.5°C pathway is not exceeded or only \\nexceeded to a limited extent, and extreme scenarios with high \\nemissions for physical risks (see risks 6, 7 and 9). The scenarios are \\nnot detailed climate scenarios based on external sources and com-\\npared with the current state of scientific knowledge but focus in \\nsimplified form on the relevant risk and opportunity drivers. With \\nregard to scenarios for transition risks, these are regulatory and \\nmarket developments in particular. For the scenarios relating to \\nphysical risks, the main drivers are an increase in extreme weather \\nevents and long-term climate change (for example in terms of tem-\\nperature). From Continental’s perspective, the selected scenarios \\ntherefore address the relevant drivers of risks and opportunities, \\nand thus also cover the relevant scenarios as defined by the ESRS. \\nFor methodological reasons, the scenarios go beyond the consider-\\nations of general risk management and the consolidated financial \\nstatements, particularly with regard to time horizons and the gross \\nassessment perspective.  \\nThe evaluation of risks included in the analysis of climate-related \\nhazards that might possibly affect Continental’s business activities \\ncovers own operations as well as the value chain. Climate-related \\nhazards include, in particular, the increase in extreme weather events \\nand long-term climate change, for example in terms of temperature.  \\nThe exposure and sensitivity of assets and business activities to the \\nidentified climate-related hazards was considered in the IRO assess-\\nment. The assessment is coordinated with general risk manage-\\nment. The magnitudes of the financial effects of the gross physical \\nrisks are reflected in the descriptions of the associated risks in the \\nClimate change (ESRS E1) section. By integrating the scenario anal-\\nysis into the IRO assessment, the same time horizons were used. \\nThe standardized time horizons of the IRO assessment do not di-\\nrectly correspond to the various expected lifetimes of Continental’s \\nassets. The “short-term” and “medium-term” levels in the IRO assess- \\nment essentially correspond to the time horizons of annual plan-\\nning and long-term planning, respectively, in the financial planning. \\nFurther information on the time horizon of long-term planning can \\nbe found, for example, in the disclosures on impairment losses in \\nNote 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In addi-\\ntion, further information on the consideration of climate risks in ac-\\ncounting can be found in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated fi-\\nnancial statements under Impact of the macroeconomic environment \\nand climate-related aspects on accounting in the reporting period. \\nFor the identification of climate-related transition risks, a climate \\nscenario with a moderate pathway towards carbon neutrality at the \\nlatest by 2050 (see risks 8, 10, 11, 12), as well as an extreme sce-\\nnario with no or only limited overshoot of 1.5°C pathway was con-\\nsidered (see risks 13, 14 and 15). Both scenarios include increasing \\nregulation, but in case of no or only a limited overshoot of 1.5°C \\nbeing allowed, it was assumed that full carbon neutrality of the \\nglobal economy would be enforced to be achieved already in the \\nmedium term.  \\nThe exposure and sensitivity of assets and business activities to the \\nidentified gross transition risks were qualitatively assessed in the \\nIRO assessment. The process was based in particular on a screen-\\ning of the product portfolio with regard to compatibility with a tran-\\nsition to climate neutrality. By applying the IRO methodology, the \\nassumptions regarding the probability, extent and duration of the \\ntransition events were taken into account. The IRO assessment \\nconcluded that Continental’s assets, business activities and product \\nportfolio are fundamentally capable of transition and do not lead to \\nany significant transition risks. The magnitudes of the financial effects \\nof the gross transition risks are reflected in the descriptions of the as-\\nsociated risks in the Climate change (ESRS E1) section. Due to the in-\\ntegration into the IRO assessment, the same time horizons apply. \\nSpecifics of the IRO assessment in relation to pollution \\nThe identification and assessment of potential and actual impacts \\nin relation to pollution in own operations, supply chain and down-\\nstream value chain included a screening of Continental’s locations \\nand business activities under consideration of the respective man-\\nagement approaches as well as the related metrics. The identifica-\\ntion and assessment were integrated in the impact, risk and oppor-\\ntunity assessment following the described methodology.\\u2009The as-\\nsessment was also compared with external data sources.  \\nContinental took into account the perspective of the affected com-\\nmunities regarding pollution through workshops with proxies from \\ninternal functions who represented their interests. The information \\nreceived was taken into account in the development of the respec-\\ntive management approaches, in particular for own operations. \\nThere was no direct consultation with affected communities.  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report \\n109\\nSpecifics of the IRO assessment in relation to water and \\nmarine resources \\nThe identification and assessment of potential and actual impacts, \\nrisks and opportunities regarding water and marine resources re-\\nlated to own operations, supply chain and downstream value chain \\nincluded a screening of Continental’s locations and business activi-\\nties under consideration of the respective management ap-\\nproaches as well as the related metrics.

There was no direct consultation with affected communities. \\nSpecifics of the IRO assessment in relation to biodiversity and \\necosystems \\nThe identification and assessment of potential and actual impacts \\nregarding biodiversity and ecosystems related to Continental’s own \\noperations, supply chain and downstream value chain were inte-\\ngrated in the impact, risk and opportunity assessment following the \\ndescribed methodology. The assessment was also compared with \\nexternal data sources (e.g. the Encore database).  \\nThe identification and assessment of potential dependencies on bi-\\nodiversity and ecosystems was included in the evaluation of risks \\nand opportunities. The focus was on whether Continental, its prod-\\nucts or its value chain are specifically dependent on biogenic mate-\\nrials that are dependent on specific ecosystems.\\u2009  \\nThe process explicitly considered transition and physical risks (see \\nrisks 30 and 31) and transition opportunities (see opportunity \\n32)\\u2009and included a consideration of geographies, industries and, in \\nparticular, the risk driver of deforestation.  \\nContinental took the macro level into consideration when identify-\\ning and assessing the IROs, including potential systemic risks, i.e. \\nrisks inherent to the industry and expert assessments.  \\nShared biological resources and ecosystems have not been specifi-\\ncally addressed as a distinct element in the IRO assessment as they \\nare not considered relevant for Continental’s value chain. \\nIn terms of biodiversity and ecosystems, the IRO assessment did \\nnot include direct consultations with affected communities at spe-\\ncific locations. Nevertheless, the defined management approach re-\\ngarding deforestation includes consultation with local stakeholders’ \\ncommunities through an industry initiative.  \\nContinental took into account the perspectives of the potentially af-\\nfected communities regarding biodiversity and ecosystems \\nthrough workshops with proxies from internal functions who repre-\\nsented their interests. The information received was taken into ac-\\ncount in the development of the respective management ap-\\nproaches, in particular for own operations. There was no direct con-\\nsultation with affected communities.  \\nContinental mitigates negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosys-\\ntems as described in the respective management approaches in \\nthe Biodiversity and ecosystems (ESRS E4) section. \\nContinental has locations in and near biodiversity-sensitive areas. In \\nthe IRO assessment, Continental concluded that the impacts of \\nthese sites on biodiversity and ecosystems are not material.  \\nIn the IRO assessment, Continental came to the conclusion that, be-\\nyond the management approaches described in the Biodiversity \\nand ecosystems (ESRS E4) section, no specific mitigation measures \\nare required in connection with biodiversity.  \\nSpecifics of the IRO assessment in relation to resource use and \\ncircular economy \\nThe identification and assessment of potential and actual impacts, \\nrisks and opportunities related to resource use and circular econ-\\nomy, in particular regarding resource inflows, resource outflows and \\nwaste in Continental’s own operations, the supply chain and down-\\nstream value chain included a screening of Continental’s locations \\nin relation to waste and business activities, especially for products \\nand materials purchased by Continental. The identification and as-\\nsessment took into account information from the respective man-\\nagement approaches as well as related metrics.  \\nThe identification and assessment were integrated in the impact, risk \\nand opportunity assessment following the described methodology. \\nContinental took into account the perspective of the affected com-\\nmunities regarding resource use and circular economy through \\nworkshops with proxies from internal functions who represented \\ntheir interests.

The organi-\\nzational structure and the management processes were systemati-\\ncally aligned with three strategic pillars:  \\n› Strengthening of operational performance, \\n› Differentiation of the portfolio, \\n› Consistent exploitation of opportunities. \\nSustainability is anchored in the strategy in a general sense as well \\nas in the “Consistent exploitation of opportunities” pillar and is a key \\nelement of the strategic focus on offering safe, intelligent and sus-\\ntainable solutions. Sustainability is also a key component of Conti-\\nnental’s vision: CREATING VALUE FOR A BETTER TOMORROW. Sus-\\ntainability is therefore a decisive factor for our value creation para-\\ndigm. As such, it is reflected in the strategies of Continental’s group \\nsectors and consequently has an impact on Continental’s business \\nmodels and the value chain.  \\nAll material impacts, risks and opportunities are addressed in Conti-\\nnental’s strategic framework. The respective elements the strategy \\nespecially also comprise the objectives of the management ap-\\nproaches as described in the respective topic-related sections. \\nWhere relevant, Continental’s main challenges are part of the de-\\ntailed descriptions of impacts, risks and opportunities. Critical solu-\\ntions or projects are either addressed by the management ap-\\nproaches, specific metrics, targets or key actions.  \\nIn our Group sustainability ambition, we describe how Continental \\nwants to shape this transformation in the relevant topic areas with \\nrespect to sustainability in order to mitigate negative impacts, rein-\\nforce positive impacts, reduce risks and seize opportunities. The \\noverarching ambition includes specific ambitions for:  \\n› Carbon neutrality along our entire value chain, \\n› Emission-free mobility and industry, \\n› Circular economy, \\n› Responsible value chain. \\nIn addition, it defines eight sustainability essentials representing the \\nbackbone of our sustainability management. The essentials include \\nfor example good working conditions as well as a sustainable man-\\nagement practice.  \\nThe four ambitions apply to the entire Continental Group and in \\nsome cases also address parts of the value chain.

In addition, short-\\nterm remuneration (short-term incentive – STI) can also include sus-\\ntainability matters. A sustainability metric was included in the STI \\nfor 2024. The LTI and STI plans are updated on an annual basis.  \\nThe sustainability related components are integrated into the over-\\nall remuneration systems.  \\nBased on the nature of long-term incentives, Continental has two \\nremuneration systems in place regarding the LTI. A new LTI struc-\\nture was introduced in 2024. The first payouts of the new model \\nwill be in 2028 for the Executive Board and in 2027 for senior ex-\\necutives and executives. \\nIn the LTI structure, starting in 2024, 20 % of the LTI is linked to \\nsustainability matters based on metrics (key performance indica-\\ntors) that are weighted and defined for each plan with specific \\nthresholds for the respective target year of the LTI plan. For the \\nplan, the metric values at the end of the period are measured \\nagainst the defined thresholds. The range of target achievement is \\n0 % to 200 %. The three sustainability metrics included in the plan \\nat the start of 2024 are own Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 \\nGHG emissions, the waste for recovery quota as well as the share \\nof women in management positions. \\nThe metric for the OUR BASICS Live Integrity Perception Index has \\nbeen integrated in the STI for 2024. \\nThe LTI structure for LTI plans with the start years from 2020 to \\n2023 is based on the relative total shareholder return (relative TSR) \\nas the material performance criterion. The performance of the TSR \\nis multiplied by a sustainability factor which consists of up to six \\nsustainability metrics. Threshold values have been defined for \\nevery plan and every metric. To calculate the sustainability factor \\nfor the Executive Board, a value is added to the initial factor of 0.7 \\nfor each threshold value reached, which is calculated by dividing \\n0.6 by the number of metrics used. The sustainability factor is a \\nmaximum of 1.3. The values are slightly adapted for senior execu-\\ntives and executives. As an example, the 2020-2023 LTI plan cov-\\nered the metrics of own Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 GHG \\nemissions, the waste for recovery quota, the accident rate, the \\nshare of women in management positions, the sick leave as well as \\nthe OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engagement Index.  \\nIn both LTI structures as well as in the STI, the achievement of sus-\\ntainability performance is measured for all Executive Board mem-\\nbers as well as for senior executives and executives on the basis of \\nthe entire Continental Group.  \\nFurther details about the remuneration system are available in the \\nremuneration report on our website under Company/Corporate \\nGovernance/Executive Board.  \\nWithin the LTI schemes, the metric for the own Scope 1 and mar-\\nket-based Scope 2 GHG emissions relate to the respective impacts, \\nrisks and targets as described in the Climate change (ESRS E1) sec-\\ntion. The metric on women in management positions relates to the \\nrespective impacts, risks and targets, as described in the Own work-\\nforce (ESRS S1) section. The thresholds of the other metrics were \\nderived from ambitions, management approaches or comparable \\nreferences.  \\nWith the current remuneration system, Continental has integrated \\nsustainability performance into the remuneration of the Executive \\nBoard, senior executives and executives.  \\nConsidering the structure of LTI plans and especially that the sys-\\ntem with starting years before 2024 used a multiplier, the propor-\\ntion of variable remuneration dependent on sustainability-related \\ntargets and impacts cannot be expressed in one figure but is in-\\nstead calculated in the respective years of payment. \\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for confirming and updating \\nthe conditions of the incentive systems (including the sustainability \\nmetrics and target and threshold values used) for the Executive \\nBoard. The remuneration system for the Executive Board is ap-\\nproved by the Annual General Meeting. The system for senior exec-\\nutives and executives is confirmed by the Executive Board.  \\nDue to the LTI structure of the 2020-2023 plan with a sustainabil-\\nity factor as a multiplier of TSR performance, the percentage of the \\nrecognized Executive Board remuneration linked to a climate-re-\\nlated consideration is 0 % in fiscal 2024. This effect results from the \\nperformance of the TSR. Further information can be found in the \\n2023 remuneration report, which is relevant for the pay out in \\n2024. \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report \\n117\\nInternal Control System for Sustainability Reporting \\nIn the reporting the ramp up and stepwise extension of a specific \\ninternal control system (ICS) for sustainability reporting was started. \\nThe main goal of the system is to ensure that process risks in the \\nimplementation of sustainability reporting are identified, docu-\\nmented and mitigated in a systematic process. The ICS for sustain-\\nability reporting is part of the overarching internal control system \\nof Continental and it has several interfaces to overall ICS processes \\nas well as to function-specific ICS processes.  \\nThe ICS for sustainability reporting is focused on public annual re-\\nporting in Continental’s annual report and especially on the sustain-\\nability report. It comprises a defined set of goals, a dedicated con-\\ntrol environment based on the overall sustainability governance, an \\nevaluation of process-inherent risks, mitigation and control pro-\\ncesses for process-inherent risks, documentation and communica-\\ntion as well as reviews and oversight. In addition, the sustainability \\nreporting itself is based on documented processes.  \\nThe process-inherent risks are evaluated by Group Sustainability on \\nan annual basis. The evaluation considers relevant external sources \\n(e.g. specific guidance), findings of internal and external audits/as-\\nsurance, own evaluations, a consultation with internal stakeholders \\nas well as general feedback. In the evaluation, risks are classified ac-\\ncording to severity and likelihood and key risks are prioritized \\nbased on this classification.  \\nThe main process risks identified for sustainability reporting for fis-\\ncal 2024 are especially related to the completeness, the interpreta-\\ntion of requirements and the consistency of the overall reporting as \\nwell as resource constraints.  \\nThe mitigation and control strategy is guided by the evaluation of \\nprocess-inherent risks. These mitigations and controls include su-\\npervisory, centralized, decentralized and other mitigation and con-\\ntrols. The identified key risks are primarily addressed by central mit-\\nigation and controls.  \\nThe oversight of the ICS is designed in a staggered approach. The \\nreview of the ICS is integrated in the dedicated review process for \\nsustainability reporting. Within the overall internal control system, \\nfurther reviews and oversight are exercised, e.g. by the internal \\naudit function. \\nPotential improvements and required action, as well as relevant \\nfindings, are reported by Group Sustainability to the relevant bodies \\nfor sustainability, especially the Sustainability Steering Committee \\nand the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n118\\nDisclosures in Accordance with the EU \\nTaxonomy Regulation \\nThe EU Taxonomy is a classification system for determining sus-\\ntainable economic activities in the real economy. The following dis-\\nclosures are the mandatory disclosures of the Continental Group in \\naccordance with Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU) \\n2020/852. \\n \\nSpecific Information on the Implementation of Disclosure Requirements in \\nAccordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852 \\nIn line with the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the Climate \\nDelegated Act (EU) 2021/2139 and Environmental Delegated Act \\n(EU) 2023/2486, companies must provide information on the eligi-\\nbility and alignment of their activities with the EU Taxonomy with \\nregard to the following environmental objectives \\n› Climate change mitigation \\n› Climate change adaptation \\n› Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources \\n› Transition to a circular economy \\n› Pollution prevention and control \\n› Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems \\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 amending the \\nClimate Delegated Act, which was published at the same time as \\nthe Environmental Delegated Act (EU) 2023/2486, amended the \\nClimate Delegated Act. Besides amendments related to the existing \\nactivities for the two climate objectives, new economic activities \\nwere also included. This affects, among others, the two economic \\nactivities of category 3.18 (Manufacture of automotive and mobil-\\nity components) and category 3.19 (Manufacture of rail rolling \\nstock constituents). Furthermore, the EU Commission made it ex-\\nplicit in Recital 10 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) \\n2023/2485 (amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139) \\nthat the activity of tire manufacturing, by virtue of its potential to \\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector, is a tax-\\nonomy-eligible activity that is currently to be allocated to category \\n3.6 (Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies). \\nIn 2024, there were no amendments introduced to the EU Taxon-\\nomy and related delegated acts. Published answers on frequently \\nasked questions by the European Commission did not influence \\nContinental’s interpretation of the reporting requirements related to \\nthe economic activities relevant for the company. Consequently, re-\\nporting under EU Taxonomy still remains associated with uncer-\\ntainty for Continental.  \\nThese uncertainties mainly result from unclear and imprecise word-\\ning used in the regulations and notes related to the assessment of \\nTaxonomy eligibility and especially Taxonomy alignment for eco-\\nnomic activities relevant for Continental as well as to the calcula-\\ntions for key performance indicators for turnover, capital expendi-\\nture and operating expenditure.  \\nAs a result, these directives and instructions still leave room for in-\\nterpretation from Continental’s perspective. \\nIn interpreting the regulation, Continental takes into consideration – \\nbesides officially published documents – the statements from in-\\ndustry associations in the supplier and automotive industries as \\nwell as unofficial assessments of various experts. \\n \\n \\n \\nSustainability Report – \\nEnvironmental Information \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n119\\nTaxonomy-Eligible Economic Activities \\nIn the reporting year 2024, Continental followed the same method-\\nology to assess Taxonomy eligibility as methodology as the previ-\\nous year. \\nIn the reporting year 2024, we allocated – as in the previous year – \\nall economic activities involved in the manufacture of automotive \\nand mobility systems and components for road vehicles – with the \\nexception of tires, but also extending beyond components for zero-\\ntailpipe-emission vehicles – to category 3.18. Continental is of the \\nopinion that the manufacture of all components, irrespective of the \\ndrive system, is taxonomy-eligible for all vehicles belonging to the \\nvehicle classes listed in the category. This classification is based on \\nthe fact that, from Continental’s perspective, the activity designa-\\ntion does not entail any restrictions in terms of components, for ex-\\nample in relation to function or drive system, and the correspond-\\ning components, parts and systems are intended for use in road ve-\\nhicles. While the qualification characteristic (criterion) contained in \\nthe description of activity 3.18 “essential contribution to environ-\\nmental performance” is not exhaustively clearly defined, it is, in \\nContinental’s view and based on the supporting documents of the \\nEuropean Commission (e.g. “A User Guide to Navigate the EU Tax-\\nonomy for Sustainable Activities” published in June 2023) – part of \\nthe assessment of Taxonomy alignment and not Taxonomy eligibility.  \\nWe allocated all economic activities involved in the manufacture of \\nrail rolling stock constituents to category 3.19. This classification is \\nbased in particular on the fact that, from Continental’s perspective, \\nthe reference to activity 3.3 does not impose any restrictions on \\ncomponents in relation to the function or drive system of rail vehi-\\ncles for which the components are manufactured, provided that \\nthe components and systems are necessary for the operation and \\nfunctioning of rail vehicles. Furthermore, the activity designation \\ndoes not entail any restrictions on components, for example in rela-\\ntion to function or drive system. \\nAs in the previous year, all activities involved in tire manufacturing \\nwere classified as taxonomy-eligible under category 3.6. In Recital \\n10 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 (amending Delegated \\nRegulation (EU) 2021/2139), the European Commission makes it \\nclear that tire manufacturing has the potential to reduce green-\\nhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and can contribute to \\na more circular economy. Until specific technical assessment crite-\\nria are defined for this activity, tire manufacturing shall remain a \\ntaxonomy-eligible activity under category 3.6 (Manufacture of \\nother low-carbon technologies). It is Continental’s opinion that this \\nclarification for the purposes of Taxonomy eligibility refers to the \\nmanufacture of tires of all kinds, without any restrictions in terms of \\nspecific properties, label classes or drive system technologies. Alter-\\nnative interpretations were examined, but Continental found them \\nto be unsuitable, particularly with regard to Recital 10. \\nIn addition, various Continental industrial businesses were classified \\nas taxonomy-eligible, as they were in the previous year. In the re-\\nporting year, these primarily comprised the manufacture of compo-\\nnents for wind turbines and the manufacture of materials for indus-\\ntrial plant insulation. Continental allocates these businesses to cate-\\ngory 3.6 (Manufacture of other low-carbon technologies), since the \\neconomic activities pursue substantial reductions and therefore \\nmake significant contributions to the expansion of renewable ener-\\ngies and energy saving, for example through insulation in industrial \\nplants. For these classifications as well, Continental believes it is ir-\\nrelevant which functions are fulfilled by the supplier technologies in \\nthe end products, as long as the end product facilitates the goals \\nset out in Art. 10 (1) of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU) \\n2020/852. \\nThe activities mentioned are not identified as taxonomy-eligible un-\\nder Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act (EU) 2021/2139 (envi-\\nronmental target “climate change adaptation”). \\nAll other economic activities of the Continental Group that are not \\nincluded in the aforementioned economic activities have been clas-\\nsified as Taxonomy-non-eligible for the reporting year. Accordingly, \\nContinental currently has not allocated any economic activities to \\nthe other environmental objectives under Annex I: Sustainable use \\nand protection of water and marine resources, Annex II: Transition \\nto a circular economy, Annex III: Pollution prevention and control or \\nAnnex IV: Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosys-\\ntems of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486. \\nWe base the classification on the information publicly available at \\nthe time the report was prepared. \\nTaxonomy-eligible turnover \\nThe information on sales is prepared in accordance with section \\n1.1.1 of Annex 1 to the Delegated Regulation on Disclosure Obliga-\\ntions (EU) 2021/2178 in compliance with IFRS accounting regula-\\ntions (see tables at the end of this non-financial statement). The \\nmethod of determination selected by Continental ensures that dou-\\nble counting is avoided. \\nA total sum of €34.1 billion was reported as taxonomy-eligible sales \\nin the reporting year (previous year: €35.9 billion), which is equiva-\\nlent to a 85.8 % share of consolidated sales (previous year: 86.6 %). \\nThe breakdown of taxonomy-eligible sales by category is shown in \\nthe tables at the end of this section. \\nInformation on the Continental Group’s total sales (the denominator \\nof the metric group calculation) can be found in the Consolidated \\nstatement of income of the consolidated financial statements un-\\nder Sales. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n120\\nTaxonomy-eligible capital expenditure and operating \\nexpenditure \\nTaxonomy-eligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure \\nhave been compiled in accordance with the Delegated Regulation \\non Disclosure Obligations (EU) 2021/2178 taking into account the \\nclarifications made by the European Commission in October 2022. \\nThe figures for taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure and operating \\nexpenditure under Category a are allocations based on the propor-\\ntion of taxonomy-eligible turnover. For reasons connected to the \\nbusiness model, the equipment, machinery and buildings of the \\nContinental Group in thus used both for taxonomy-eligible activities \\nand for other activities. \\nThe allocation takes place at group sector level, and not at the level \\nof individual locations, in order to avoid double counting, to take \\ninto account intercompany business and consolidation effects as \\nwell as to reflect the matrix structure of the Continental Group. This \\nallocation of turnover thus reflects the distribution of Continental’s \\nproduction. The Platform on Sustainable Finance also recommends \\nsuch an approach to allocation in its report to the European Com-\\nmission dated October 2022. For enabling activities, it states that \\ncapital expenditure and operating expenditure should be reported \\non the basis of their proportion of sales provided the activities are \\ntaxonomy-eligible and that they not do not include non-taxonomy-\\neligible activities. \\nA total sum of €1,892 million was reported as taxonomy-eligible \\ncapital expenditure in the reporting year (previous year: €2,141 \\nmillion), which is equivalent to a 85.8 % share of total capital ex-\\npenditure (previous year: 87.9 %). The breakdown of taxonomy-eli-\\ngible capital expenditure by category is shown in the tables at the \\nend of this section. \\nThe information on capital expenditure is prepared in accordance \\nwith section 1.1.2 of Annex 1 to the Delegated Regulation on Dis-\\nclosure Obligations (EU) 2021/2178 compliance with IFRS ac-\\ncounting regulations. Information on the Continental Group’s total \\ncapital expenditure can be found in Note 1 of the notes to the con-\\nsolidated financial statements. The information refers to capital ex-\\npenditure in the intangible assets (Note 13), property, plant and \\nequipment (Note 14), leases (Note 15) and investment property \\n(Note 16) presented in the notes to the consolidated financial state-\\nments. \\nOperating expenditure is defined in accordance with section 1.1.3 \\nof Annex 1 to the Delegated Regulation on Disclosure Obligations \\n(EU) 2021/2178 and has been calculated on an imputed basis as \\ndescribed above. For the denominator of the metric calculation for \\noperating expenditure, Continental takes into account direct, non-\\ncapitalized costs incurred in the reporting year as a result of re-\\nsearch and development (net), building renovation measures, short-\\nterm leasing, and maintenance and repairs. \\nA total sum of €3,421 million was reported as taxonomy-eligible \\noperating expenditure in the reporting year (previous year: €3,572 \\nmillion), which is equivalent to a 85.8 % share of total operating ex-\\npenditure (previous year: 90.5 %). The breakdown of taxonomy-eli-\\ngible operating expenditure by category is shown in the tables at \\nthe end of this section. \\nContinental notes that, from its perspective, various interpretations \\nwith respect to the requirements concerning capital expenditure \\nand operating expenditure, particularly for category c and for oper-\\nating expenditure more generally, continue to result in uncertainty \\nwhen determining Taxonomy-related information. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n121\\nTaxonomy-Aligned Economic Activities \\nFor all economic activities reported under category 3.6, specific \\ncomparative life cycle analyses are required by the technical \\nscreening criteria on substantial contribution to climate change \\nmitigation. These must demonstrate substantial savings to life cycle \\ngreenhouse gas emissions compared with the highest-performing \\nalternative technology or solution available on the market or the \\nhighest-performing alternative product available on the market. \\nThese life cycle analyses and their external verification should be \\nbased on certain guidelines and recommendations.  \\nContinental did not have corresponding comparative life cycle anal-\\nyses at its disposal in the reporting year, meaning that it is currently \\nnot possible to allocate taxonomy-aligned economic activities. For \\nthis reason, the DNSH criteria (Do No Significant Harm criteria) and \\nthe minimum safeguards along the value chain were not assessed \\naccording to specific economic activities. \\nContinental has evaluated compliance of its taxonomy-eligible ac-\\ntivities under categories 3.18 and 3.19 with the qualification char-\\nacteristics and the fulfillment of additional criteria set out with re-\\ngard to substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. From \\nContinental’s perspective, the qualification characteristic (criterion) \\nin the description of the activity 3.18 in the existing regulation \\nleaves room for interpretation and therefore bears relevant uncer-\\ntainty regarding suitable methodology needed to assess whether a \\nproduct is essential for delivering and improving the environmental \\nperformance of the vehicle. In view of this fact, Continental consid-\\ners its products listed in the European Commission Delegated Reg-\\nulation (EU) 2023/2485 in Recital 9 to be in line with the descrip-\\ntion of activity 3.18. and the qualification characteristic included in \\nit. These products were taken into account in the further course of \\nthe taxonomy alignment assessment. \\nThe qualification characteristic (criterion) on the essentiality of \\ncomponents for the functioning of rail rolling stock contained in \\nthe description of the activity 3.19 allows Continental to take into \\nconsideration the full variety of the rolling stock portfolio for the \\nfurther alignment assessment.  \\nHowever, the consideration of the technical screening criteria for \\nsubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation for activities \\n3.18 and 3.19 leads to narrowing of the product list for more in-\\ndepth analysis on the fulfillment of DNSH criteria to products allo-\\ncated to zero tailpipe emission vehicles. \\nAccording to the EU Taxonomy Regulation, only activities that fulfill \\nthe DNSH criteria relevant for their respective category can be clas-\\nsified as taxonomy-aligned. The DNSH criteria for categories 3.18 \\nand 3.19 contain a criterion on pollution prevention and control cri-\\nterion, which is explained in more detail in Annex C of the Euro-\\npean Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485. \\nThe requirements of the EU Taxonomy for fulfilling the DNSH crite-\\nrion mentioned above require the conduct and documentation of \\nsubstitution tests for some substances and thus go beyond the cur-\\nrently applicable framework provisions. At present, Continental’s \\nmanagement systems do not provide sufficient information to fulfill \\nthese additional requirements of the EU Taxonomy with regard to \\nthe monitoring of the substances used and the conduct of substitu-\\ntion tests for the substances listed in Annex C. Therefore, these re-\\nquirements cannot be substantiated by Continental. Following an \\ninternal analysis of the technical screening criteria and in view of \\nthe uncertainties related to their interpretation, Continental does \\nnot currently classify any activities in categories 3.18 and 3.19 as \\ntaxonomy-aligned. \\nTaxonomy-aligned turnover, capital expenditure and \\noperating expenditure \\nSince Continental does not currently report any activities as taxon-\\nomy-aligned, no taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure or operating \\nexpenditure according to Categories a and b are reported. Since no \\ntaxonomy-eligible capital expenditure or operating expenditure un-\\nder Category c were identified, no taxonomy-aligned capital ex-\\npenditure or operating expenditure under Category c are reported. \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n122\\nInformation to Be Disclosed in Accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation \\nFor the following overviews of taxonomy information, it should be \\nnoted that these were prepared in accordance with the guidelines \\nfor the templates in Annex 2 to the Delegated Regulation on Disclo-\\nsure Obligations (EU) 2021/2178.

The general disclosures in-\\nclude an overview of the assessment of all identified impacts, risks \\nand opportunities (IROs), including the time horizons considered. \\nIn this IRO assessment, the following material potential and actual \\nnegative and positive impacts, risks and opportunities have been \\nidentified in relation to climate change. They have been grouped \\ninto IRO clusters for easier understanding and reading. The descrip-\\ntions of the negative impacts and risks are presented from a gross \\nperspective which, on the basis of the applied methodology, does \\nnot take into account mitigation through the management ap-\\nproaches of Continental as described in the respective IRO cluster. \\nThis perspective is used to determine where appropriate manage-\\nment approaches are relevant and corresponding reporting is re-\\nquired. As positive impacts as well as opportunities are strength-\\nened by Continental’s management approaches, the descriptions \\nare presented from a net perspective which, for methodical rea-\\nsons, considers the results of the management approaches. \\nThe descriptions of the IROs are to be regarded as self-contained, \\nwhich may result in repetitions. \\nRisks 6, 7 and 9 represent climate-related physical risks. The re-\\nmaining identified risks are transition risks. \\nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions \\n› Continental has moderate Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emis-\\nsions in own operations which contribute to global climate \\nchange and are therefore considered relevant for corporate re-\\nsponsibility. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 2)  \\n› Continental considers the negative impacts of its energy con-\\nsumption to be limited. Taking into account the share of fossil \\nfuels in energy consumption, it is considered relevant for the in-\\nformation needs of users of sustainability reporting. (see ESRS 2, \\nIRO table, impact 5) \\n› Continental operates in industries and certain markets where fast-\\nincreasing regulatory requirements related to specific aspects of \\nclimate change mitigation could lead to a significant devaluation \\nof real estate assets in specific businesses, especially in the me-\\ndium-term, if not managed adequately and preventively. (see \\nESRS 2, IRO table, risk 10) \\n› Continental operates in regions and industries where a moderate \\nincrease in investment and operating costs related to climate \\nchange mitigation (e.g. transformation of production sites) or reg-\\nulatory requirements (e.g. trading schemes) can be expected es-\\npecially in the medium-term. This risk is considered relevant for \\nthe information needs of users of sustainability reporting. (see \\nESRS 2, IRO table, risk 12) \\n› Continental operates in regions and industries where, in the un-\\nlikely event of regulation allowing no or only limited overshoot of \\na 1.5°C temperature increase, a significant increase in investment \\nand operating costs related to climate change mitigation can be \\nexpected especially in the medium-term. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, \\nrisk 13) \\nScope 3, portfolio resilience and transition \\n› Continental has significant Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions re-\\nlated to the so-called CO2 backpack which especially includes the \\npurchased goods and services as well as the disposal of products \\nat the end of the life cycle. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 1) \\n› Continental has substantive direct and indirect Scope 3 green-\\nhouse gas emissions especially from the use phase of its prod-\\nucts. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 3) \\n› Continental develops and manufactures components and sys-\\ntems for zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles and low-carbon industries \\nand thus presumably has to some extend positive impacts on the \\ntransition of markets to carbon neutrality which are considered to \\nbe relevant for further expansion. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 4)  \\n› Continental’s product portfolio serves markets which are trans-\\nforming considerably because of climate change-related regula-\\ntory requirements and market trends (e.g. gradual shift away from \\ncombustion engines or phase-out of fossil fuels). Given the broad-\\nness of Continental's portfolio, some product segments and the \\nbusiness with specific customer groups might face transforma-\\ntional challenges and the speed of change could exceed the po-\\ntential speed of adaptation. This can, if not managed adequately, \\nlead to significant loss in sales in the respective businesses, espe-\\ncially in the long run. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 8) \\n› Continental’s product portfolio serves markets in which, in the un-\\nlikely event of regulation allowing no or only limited overshoot of \\na 1.5°C temperature increase, would result in extreme transfor-\\nmation (e.g. abrupt phase-out of combustion engines and fossil \\nfuels). Given the broadness of Continental's portfolio, most product  \\nClimate Change (ESRS E1) \\n\", \" \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n127\\n  \\n› segments and the business with most customer groups would \\nface extreme transformational challenges and the speed of \\nchange would exceed the potential speed of adaptation. This \\ncould, if not managed adequately, potentially lead to a critical loss \\nin sales in the respective businesses, especially in the medium \\nterm. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 15) \\n› Continental's product portfolio serves markets which are also \\ntransforming considerably because of climate change mitigation-\\nrelated regulatory and market trends (e.g. zero-tailpipe-emission \\nvehicles). This could increase demand for certain businesses of \\nContinental. If Continental can utilize these trends effectively, spe-\\ncific businesses (e.g. dealing with brakes, high performance tires \\nand hydrogen) can profit directly or indirectly from significant \\ngrowth opportunities or even new business areas/models in the \\nmedium term. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, opportunity 16) \\nClimate change adaptation \\n› Continental operates in regions and industries where a significant \\nincrease in investment and operating costs related to climate \\nchange adaptation could be expected, particularly in the long \\nterm, considering physical climate change, especially in terms of \\ntemperature increases and the associated need for cooling. (see \\nESRS 2, IRO table, risk 9) \\n› Continental is present in regions and at locations where a risk of \\nlimited devaluation of real estate assets and/or stranded assets \\ndue to physical climate change, with increasing extreme weather \\nevents, might be possible especially in the long term, if not man-\\naged preventively. This risk is considered relevant for the infor-\\nmation needs of users of sustainability reporting. (see ESRS 2, IRO \\ntable, risk 6) \\nSupply chain resilience and transition \\n› Continental buys numerous products and services from a global \\nsupplier base. Therefore, Continental’s direct and indirect suppli-\\ners operate in industries and certain markets which might be sub-\\nject to increasing regulatory requirements and major transfor-\\nmation in relation to climate change mitigation (e.g. trading sys-\\ntems and the transition of suppliers' production sites). In addition, \\nthe demand for products and services with a low carbon footprint \\nmight increase faster than the supply. Both aspects can lead to \\nsignificantly higher costs for materials, components and/or ser-\\nvices especially in the medium term, if not managed preventively. \\n(see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 11) \\n› Continental buys numerous products and services from a global \\nsupplier base. Continental’s direct and indirect suppliers also op-\\nerate in industries and certain markets which could be subject to \\nextreme transformation and regulatory requirements related to \\nclimate change mitigation in the unlikely event of a regulation al-\\nlowing no or only limited overshoot of a 1.5°C temperature in-\\ncrease. In addition, the demand for products and services with a \\nlow carbon footprint might increase faster than the supply. Both \\naspects might possibly lead to a critical increase in costs for ma-\\nterials, components and/or services in the medium term, if not \\nmanaged preventively. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 14) \\n› Continental buys numerous products and services from a global \\nsupplier base. Therefore, Continental’s direct and indirect suppli-\\ners operate in geographies, industries and certain markets which \\nmight be affected by physical climate change, including more ex-\\ntreme weather events and increasing long-term climate change. \\nThis can lead to moderate supply chain interruptions or material \\nshortages especially in the long term, if not managed preven-\\ntively. This risk is considered relevant for the information needs of \\nusers of sustainability reporting.

The scenarios are de-\\nscribed in the subsection Specifics of the IRO assessment in rela-\\ntion to climate change in the General disclosures (ESRS 2) section. \\nThe use of scenarios and assumptions by definition leads to uncer-\\ntainties in the outcome of the analysis. Further factors considered \\nincluded especially the following: reduced overall emissions of \\ngreenhouse gases (GHG) and reduced energy consumption due to \\na switch of fuels towards low-carbon alternatives, enhanced energy \\nefficiency, increased deployment of renewable energy, higher pro-\\nduction share of zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles as well as different \\nspeeds of transition to low-carbon technologies. To assess the resili-\\nence of Continental’s business model to the identified risks and op-\\nportunities, a net assessment was carried out considering the exist-\\ning management approaches, targets and key actions to achieve \\nthe targets related to climate change. \\nBased on the IRO assessment considering the associated limita-\\ntions, uncertainties, time horizons and assumptions as outlined in \\nsubsection Process for identifying and assessing material IROs in \\nthe General disclosures (ESRS 2) section as well as taking into ac-\\ncount the management approaches Continental considers its busi-\\nness model and strategy to be resilient. The management ap-\\nproaches, targets and key actions laid out in this section for achiev-\\ning the targets describe Continental’s capability to reduce its mate-\\nrial negative impacts, increase positive impacts, manage risks and \\nseize opportunities over short-, medium- and long-term. Continental \\nalso assumes that these capabilities will continue to develop over \\ntime. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n129\\n  \\nManagement Approaches to Climate Change Mitigation, Climate Change Adaptation, \\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy \\nRegarding climate change, Continental has implemented manage-\\nment approaches that include the following IRO clusters: Scope 1 \\nand Scope 2 emissions, Scope 3 emissions, portfolio resilience and \\ntransition, climate change adaptation, and supply chain resilience \\nand transition. The following table illustrates the topic areas that are \\naddressed by the specific management approaches. \\n \\n \\nClimate change \\nmitigation \\nClimate change \\nadaptation \\nEnergy efficiency \\nRenewable energy \\ndeployment \\nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions \\nX \\n \\nX \\nX \\nScope 3 emissions, portfolio resilience and transition \\nX \\n \\nX \\nX \\nClimate change adaptation \\n \\nX \\n \\n \\nSupply chain resilience and transition \\nX \\nX \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions \\nContinental pursues the ambition of achieving full carbon neutrality \\nfor its own operations by 2040 and for the entire value chain by \\n2050 at the latest. To support this ambition, Continental has imple-\\nmented a management approach that focuses on minimizing nega-\\ntive environmental impacts and risks in relation to Scope 1 and \\nScope 2 GHG emissions. The management approach also ad-\\ndresses the minimization of transition risks related to Scope 1 and \\nScope 2.  \\nThe management approach for Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emis-\\nsions covers the entire Continental Group and focuses especially \\non the production sites, as they are particularly emission-intensive \\ncompared to other types of locations.  \\nResponsibility for the operational implementation of the manage-\\nment approach to reduce GHG emissions lies with the respective \\nlegal entities. The local management is supported by various func-\\ntions in the organization, e.g. by the departments such as opera-\\ntions, infrastructure, real estate management and purchasing. The \\nGroup’s internal framework is defined by the responsible depart-\\nments (e.g. environment and operations) of Continental and is mon-\\nitored by the Executive Board of the overall Group as well as the in-\\ndividual group sector boards.  \\nContinental has established several processes to continuously re-\\nduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, to promote the transition to \\ncarbon neutrality and to create a framework for specific quantified \\ntargets and measures.  \\nContinental pursues a GHG reduction target covering Scope 1 and \\nmarket-based Scope 2 GHG emissions. Progress is monitored \\nthrough regularly reported emission values (see subsection Targets \\nrelated to climate change). The process includes dedicated GHG  \\ndata analyses at various organizational levels and – where neces-\\nsary – updates to the target paths. The results are regularly pre-\\nsented to the Sustainability Steering Committee. GHG emission \\ndata serves as the basis for the creation of an overarching Decar-\\nbonization Roadmap 2040 (see subsection Key actions for target \\nachievement), which provides a framework for implementing the \\nnecessary measures and is regularly updated based on actual \\nemission values. Continuous calibration of the levers required to \\npursue the target path is a key element of the roadmap process. \\nThe Decarbonization Roadmap 2040 applies to the whole Conti-\\nnental Group and is further operationalized in the group sectors \\nthrough their own roadmaps for technology transition. Formalized \\nregular exchange on best practices (e.g. by functions such as infra-\\nstructure and environment) supports the implementation of tech-\\nnical solutions and the corresponding program management \\nwithin Continental’s group sectors. \\nThe implementation of the Decarbonization Roadmap 2040 is also \\nsupported by measures to optimize energy consumption and en-\\nergy costs. This also includes the expansion of capacities for the in-\\nhouse generation of electricity from renewable sources as a substi-\\ntute for the external purchase of green electricity (see subsection \\nKey actions for target achievement). General increases in energy ef-\\nficiency (e.g. through LED lighting) are part of the continuous im-\\nprovement processes within the local environmental and energy \\nmanagement systems. \\nRegarding the risk of a devaluation of its own real estate because \\nof climate change mitigation regulations, Continental is striving to \\nincrease transparency regarding its real estate portfolio. To this end, \\na system that provides information on ESG-relevant real estate data \\n(including the GHG emissions caused by the operation of the build-\\nings) was tested at some pilot locations and in some acquisition \\ntransactions in the reporting year.  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n130\\n  \\nThe framework for the management approach for Scope 1 and \\nScope 2 emissions is set by internal climate protection rules, the \\nDecarbonization Roadmap 2040 and the sustainability ambition. \\nWithin the management approach and local management systems, \\nthe standards ISO 14001 (Environmental management systems) \\nand ISO 50001 (Energy management systems) are applied. The \\ncalculation and reporting of GHG emissions are carried out in ac-\\ncordance with the standards set by the GHG protocol. Furthermore, \\nmultiple climate change mitigation agreements (e.g. the Paris \\nAgreement) as well as regulatory requirements (e.g. the EU Emis-\\nsions Trading System) serve as references. \\nThe management approach for Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emis-\\nsions considers the global interest in climate change mitigation of \\nvarious stakeholders. The expectations and requirements of cus-\\ntomers and capital markets to make a positive contribution to cli-\\nmate change mitigation through their value chains are at the fore-\\nfront. \\nCommunication of the management approach takes place inter-\\nnally via various conferences and publications on the company-\\nwide intranet. The management approach is communicated to ex-\\nternal stakeholders by means of sustainability reporting, press re-\\nleases, dialogues with customers and investors, as well as trade \\nfairs. \\n \\nScope 3 emissions, portfolio resilience and transition \\nThe management approach for Scope 3 emissions, portfolio resili-\\nence and transition aims to support Continental on its path to car-\\nbon neutrality along the entire value chain by 2050 at the latest. As \\ndescribed in the IROs (see subsection Material impacts, risks and \\nopportunities related to climate change), Continental operates in in-\\ndustries that are undergoing major changes. The main objective of \\nthe management approach is to successfully steer own operations, \\ntaking into account the different transformation speeds of our cus-\\ntomers, sectors and markets.  \\nThe management approach encompasses the entire Continental \\nGroup, its global portfolio and covers all 15 categories of Scope 3 \\nGHG emissions as defined by the GHG Protocol. The focus here is \\non the most relevant categories associated with the use phase of \\nthe products sold (category 11) and the carbon backpack. It in-\\ncludes especially purchased goods and services (category 1), capi-\\ntal goods (category 2) and emissions at the end of the life cycle \\n(category 12). \\nSteering and adaptation of the respective portfolio take place in the \\nresponsible business functions, e.g. research and development \\n(R&D), product design, supply chain management and purchasing. \\nThese are supported by the sustainability departments. Oversight \\nof the portfolio management is exercised by the Executive Board \\nthrough, for example, the strategy process. \\nThe management approach comprises processes to create trans-\\nparency, identify levers and implement relevant measures. \\nThe basis for the management of Scope 3 emissions, portfolio resil-\\nience and transition is the transparency with regard to the 15 cate-\\ngories of Scope 3 GHG emissions and our portfolio of zero-tailpipe-\\nemission vehicles. Levers to reduce emissions are identified on a \\ncontinuous basis in the respective processes, with a focus on the \\nuse phase and the carbon backpack. \\nThe mitigation of material risks and impacts from the use phase of \\nproducts is primarily related to managing the portfolio resilience \\nand transition in the respective businesses. Important related pro-\\ncesses are market monitoring, optimization of R&D activities, active \\nportfolio management and a close dialogue with customers. This \\nalso includes regular assessments of the transferability of the port-\\nfolio on the path to carbon neutrality. \\nFor Scope 3 GHG backpack emissions, the core resource inflow as-\\npects related to the purchased goods, services and capital goods \\nare mainly managed within the relevant functions. The correspond-\\ning management practices include, for example, selection of less \\nemission-intensive materials and suppliers, the active supplier de-\\nvelopment and the commitment of suppliers to climate change mit-\\nigation. These practices are integrated in our general procurement \\nand supplier management processes, which are managed by the \\npurchasing functions. In addition, product design that focuses on \\nreducing the carbon footprint of products is another measure that \\nis handled by the product development and R&D departments. \\nAspects in connection with the emissions at the end of the life cy-\\ncle are mainly managed within product design processes, e.g. by fo-\\ncusing on easier disassembly for reutilization and developing less \\nemission-intensive recycling methods (see Resource use and circu-\\nlar economy (ESRS E5) section). Further potential for minimizing \\nemissions lies in optimizing the transportation of goods, business \\ntravel and employee commuting as well as other processes in con-\\nnection with the carbon backpack. \\nContinental’s sustainability ambition sets the overarching frame-\\nwork for the definition and implementation of measures. For the dif-\\nferent business process, further internal rules apply directly or indi-\\nrectly addressing climate change mitigation. \\nIn addition, the management approach is based on the GHG Proto-\\ncol and related standards (e.g. Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) ac-\\ncounting and reporting standard) as external frameworks for CO2 \\nemissions accounting. \\nThe management approach and associated measures take into \\nconsideration in particular the requirements of customers and the \\nrequests of investors. Consultations and dialogue with suppliers are \\nkey elements for the implementation of carbon backpack-related \\nlevers. \\n', \" \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n131\\n  \\nContinental communicates its approach to managing Scope 3 \\nemissions as well as portfolio resilience and transition externally \\nthrough reporting, trade fairs, press releases and investor dialogue. \\nInternal communication takes place via various channels such as \\nsustainability and product-related conferences, working groups and \\nthe company-wide intranet. \\n \\nClimate change adaptation \\nTo mitigate the risks of a devaluation of the real estate portfolio and \\nof rising operating costs and investments due to physical climate \\nchange, Continental has established management approaches that \\ncover the processes for selecting real estate and company loca-\\ntions as well as technical measures for adapting new production \\nsites and measures aimed at changing the behavior of employees.  \\nThese approaches cover Continental’s own operations. The focus is \\non assets that may bear certain limitations in terms of their adapta-\\nbility and on potential new locations. \\nThe primary responsibility for the implementation of the risk miti-\\ngation measures lies with the operational business, supported by \\nvarious functions within the organization, e.g. real estate manage-\\nment, Continental insurance services as well as technical depart-\\nments specialized in buildings and infrastructure. \\nWhen selecting new operating sites, Continental considers, among \\nother things, risks associated with existing exposure to extreme \\nweather events, which could be exacerbated by physical climate \\nchange. To avoid these potential new risks by adding new locations \\nto the real estate portfolio, Continental has included corresponding \\nrequirements in its guidelines for the selection process for new lo-\\ncations. The aim of these requirements is to gain knowledge about \\nthe exposure of assets considered to a variety of weather events \\nand other natural disasters and to incorporate the results of the as-\\nsessment in the final decision. \\nIn the existing real estate portfolio, the climate conditions are moni-\\ntored at the respective locations. As part of the improvement and \\noptimization of production processes and working conditions, the \\nsites assess cost-efficient options for heating, cooling and ventila-\\ntion case-by-case, considering the potential for reducing energy \\ncosts and other operating costs, which is particularly relevant in re-\\nlation to risks associated with long-term climate change (such as \\nrises in temperature). Respective measures are implemented locally \\nwithin regular site management processes and in alignment with \\nthe centrally supporting departments. \\nAn additional lever for curbing the increasing operating costs is to \\nraise employee’s awareness of the impact that individual behavior \\npatterns have on the development of the overall energy demand.  \\nThe implementation of this lever includes, for example, various \\ntraining courses and campaigns promoting the importance of the \\nresponsible use of energy to reduce the costs related to heating, \\ncooling, and ventilation. \\nIn addition, risk reduction regarding certain natural hazards and ex-\\ntreme weather events, considering the given current exposure, is \\npart of the location-related actuarial risk management process with \\nthe resulting organizational and technical measures. Responsibility \\nfor implementing these measures lies with the operating business. \\nThe selection process for new locations and the management of \\nthe real estate portfolio follow the general internal rules. Conti-\\nnental also has its own requirements for building construction and \\noperation, which consider factors such as insulation, for example. \\nIn addition, the Decarbonization Roadmap 2040 described in the \\nmanagement approach for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions pro-\\nvides a supporting set of rules for reducing the costs of cooling, \\nheating, and ventilation. \\nThe management approach relies on international standards ISO \\n14001 and ISO 50001 related to energy management and the \\ntechnical requirements of the buildings, including the consideration \\nof local regulatory requirements.  \\nIn the processes of implementation of the management approach \\nregarding climate change adaptation, especially the interests of \\nContinental's employees regarding working conditions (e.g. temper-\\nature and fresh air) at the relevant locations are considered. \\nCommunication with employees generally takes place at location \\nlevel. Detailed information on the general forms of engagement \\nand communication with employees are included in the Own work-\\nforce (ESRS S1) section. \\n \\nSupply chain resilience and transition \\nWith the management approach for supply chain resilience and \\ntransition, Continental aims to ensure continuity in the supply \\nchains, prevent interruptions and successfully reduce the cost pres-\\nsure associated with the transition. In this connection, Continental \\nstrives to strengthen the overall resilience of the supply chain and \\nthus to be prepared to manage the risks that arise in certain supply \\nchains in the medium and long term.  \\nThe management approach for supply chain resilience and transi-\\ntion focuses on the Continental Group’s upstream value chain, and \\nparticularly on the direct supplier base. There are no geographical \\nrestrictions or product group limitations.  \\n\", ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n132\\n  \\nResponsibility for compliance with the relevant processes lies with \\nContinental’s purchasing and supply chain management functions, \\nwhich are supported by internal risk management. The processes \\nare monitored as part of general business supervision at various or-\\nganizational levels.  \\nManagement of the climate-related aspects of supply chain resili-\\nence and transition is integrated into the general processes for \\nmanaging supply chain resilience. These processes are handled \\nclosely to the operational business and are integrated into the gen-\\neral practices regarding purchasing, supply chain management and \\nrisk management on different levels of the organization. Various as-\\npects are considered during the procurement process, including \\nstrategic factors such as security of supply in the event of extreme \\nweather events, which could be exacerbated by climate change. \\nFurther information on the relevant processes can be found in the \\nReport on risks and opportunities section of the management report. \\nThe processes are guided by a set of general rules for the related \\nfunctions on different levels of the organization. \\nThe management approach is not based on a specific external set \\nof rules. \\nClose dialogue with customers and suppliers is a key element of \\nthe management approach. \\nAs the processes are implemented close to operational business, \\ncommunication with internal stakeholders takes place mainly \\nwithin the respective businesses. The primary form of external \\ncommunication is close dialogue with customers and suppliers. \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n133\\n  \\nTargets Related to Climate Change \\nFollowing its sustainability ambition, Continental has set a public sus-\\ntainability target (PST) related to climate change that aims at the re-\\nduction of Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions to an \\nabsolute value of 0.5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (million \\ntCO2e) by 2035.  \\nThe interim target for 2030 is to reduce Scope 1 and market-based \\nScope 2 GHG emissions to 0.7 million tCO2e. \\nBoth the main and the interim target are set as absolute values and \\nmeasured in millions of metric tons of CO2 equivalents (million tCO2e). \\nThe formalized target commitment to reduce Scope 1 and market-\\nbased Scope 2 GHG emissions is a key element of the corresponding \\nmanagement approach to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and the \\nsubsequent key actions. The transition towards and, in the end, the \\nachievement of the target allows Continental to mitigate negative im-\\npacts and risks connected to Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. \\nThe target covers the combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 \\nGHG emissions. In view of the relatively low amount of remaining mar-\\nket-based Scope 2 GHG emissions (see subsection Key actions for tar-\\nget achievement), the reduction of Scope 1 GHG emissions is a partic-\\nular focus and will contribute the major share to the GHG emissions \\nreductions. The target value was defined in alignment with the guid-\\nance of the GHG Protocol on calculating Scope 1 and market-based \\nScope 2 GHG emissions and includes the greenhouse gases de-\\nscribed in the metric “Combined own Scope 1 and market-based \\nScope 2 GHG emissions.” Consequently, the greenhouse gases cov-\\nered by the target and considered in the metrics are consistent with \\nthe limits of the greenhouse gas inventory.  \\nThe scope of the main and interim targets extends to the Continental \\nGroup’s own operations. \\nThe original target trajectory was developed using the base year \\n2019. The originally publicly reported baseline value amounted to 3.2 \\nmillion tCO2e for Scope 1 and location-based Scope 2 GHG emissions. \\nThe chosen base year is representative in terms of external factors af-\\nfecting the energy consumption and hence, GHG emissions. Due to a \\nrelevant change to the company structure in 2021 as well as the in-\\ntroduction of the market-based approach for the reporting of Scope 2 \\nGHG emissions, a comparable reference value for the base year 2019 \\nwas re-modeled ex-post, and is estimated to around 2.8 million tCO2e. \\nContinental points out that there are uncertainties  \\nconnected to the data model. In 2024, by decision of the Sustainabil-\\nity Steering Committee, the target was reconfirmed without changes \\nto the target value, target pathway or target year. The baseline values \\nfor the reconfirmed target can be seen in the metric “Combined own \\nScope 1 and market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions.” The metric com-\\nplies with the ESRS requirements for the calculation of Scope 1 and \\nScope 2 GHG emissions. \\nContinental is of the opinion that the set Scope 1 and Scope 2 target \\nis based on scientific evidence. It should be noted that relevant uncer-\\ntainty remains regarding the breakdown of the global reduction path-\\nway in line with the 1.5°C scenario down to the company level. \\nGreater uncertainties are also associated with the allocation of the \\nCO2 budgets to the various industrial sectors and the extent to which \\nof so-called negative emissions (CO2 removals) can be used if the \\n1.5°C path is exceeded to a limited extent. Continental’s climate target \\nwas reviewed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2020, \\nusing the original base year 2019 as a benchmark. A re-validation by \\nthe SBTi did not take place. Based on the Continental’s ambition to \\nachieve carbon neutrality in own operations by 2040 at the latest and \\non the applied methodology, linear derivations of the required emis-\\nsions values for the year 2030 were validated and confirmed as being \\ncompliant with the Paris Agreement. Considering the modeled refer-\\nence value and the updated pathway, Continental views its emissions \\nreduction target to be still in line with the level of ambition of the origi-\\nnal reduction pathway. \\nThe target setting followed the methodology of an absolute reduction \\nas described by SBTi in the framework “Foundations of Science-based \\nTarget Setting (Version 1.0)”, including the defined underlying climate \\nand policy scenarios. The derivation was based on a cross-sector \\nemissions pathway. \\nNo anticipated external developments and their impact on green-\\nhouse gas emissions were explicitly considered when setting the tar-\\nget. Significant changes to Continental’s company structure, product \\nportfolio or production volumes might lead to the adjustment of the \\ntarget values. \\nIn 2024, no changes were made to the target values. \\nWhen setting the target, Continental considered the interests of differ-\\nent stakeholders (such as customers, authorities), e.g. by applying the \\nSBTi methodology. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n134\\n  \\nTo reach the target level of GHG emissions, Continental has identified \\ntwo primary decarbonization levers. \\n› Continued purchase of green electricity: Continental purchases \\nelectricity exclusively from renewable energy sources. Various \\ncontractual instruments are used for this purpose, which are \\nlisted in the corresponding metrics. Continuation of this approach \\nallows the avoidance of market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions \\nfrom electricity consumption. \\n› Technological transformation: This lever is closely linked to the \\noperational processes and is formalized in the technology trans-\\nformation roadmaps of the individual group sectors. It consists \\nprimarily of the sub-levers such as the phase-out of coal, the \\ngradual phase-out of other fossil fuels, the switch to biofuels and \\nbiomass as well as increased electrification of production pro-\\ncesses that were previously run on fossil fuels. \\nAccording to Continental’s assessment, the targeted GHG reductions \\nwill be fully, i.e. to 100 %, achieved through combination of the two \\naforementioned decarbonization levers. The two levers are inextrica-\\nbly linked, and both have a simultaneous effect on Scope 1 and Scope \\n2 emissions. Any further breakdown of the contributions into Scope 1 \\nand Scope 2 is therefore not meaningful. \\nContinental sees the increase in energy efficiency and the expansion \\nof capacities for self-generation of electricity from renewable sources \\nprimarily not as direct, but as supporting levers for target achieve-\\nment. \\nContinental is of the opinion that the implementation of these levers \\nwith the speed required to achieve the target is in line with the 1.5°C \\npathway as set out in the original target setting. \\nThe operationalization of these decarbonization levers through the \\nkey actions is reflected in the Decarbonization Roadmap 2040, with \\nwhich Continental is creating a framework for target achievement.  \\nContinental’s progress regarding the set emissions reduction target \\ncan be derived from the metric “Combined own Scope 1 and market-\\nbased Scope 2 GHG emissions.” \\nProgress is measured using the defined metric, which was fully \\nadapted to the ESRS requirements in 2024. In 2024, there were no \\nsignificant changes to the business model and business activities that \\ncould potentially affect the target achievement. In Continental’s opin-\\nion, progress towards achieving the target by 2024 is in line with the \\noriginal plans. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n135\\n  \\nKey Actions for Target Achievement \\nContinental has defined concrete key actions to achieve its Scope \\n1 and market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions reduction target set \\nfor 2035 and to further foster the transition to carbon neutrality. \\nCorresponding decarbonization measures are embedded in the op-\\nerational activities and are gradually being developed and imple-\\nmented by the individual legal entities. The decentralized approach \\npursued leads to a large number of measures that are completed \\nthrough specific projects with individual completion timelines rang-\\ning from short-term to long-term.  \\nContinental’s climate change mitigation measures cover all types of \\nactivities in own operations. \\nThe Decarbonization Roadmap 2040 introduced in 2021 is the in-\\nternal set of rules for determining the key actions required to \\nachieve the emissions reduction target.  \\nThe Decarbonization Roadmap 2040 focuses on the most im-\\nportant levers (see subsection Targets related to climate change) \\nwhich are further operationalized through concrete actions. \\nContinued purchase of green electricity \\nContinental purchases electricity solely from renewable energy \\nsources. In doing so, Continental makes use of green electricity con-\\ntracts, power purchase agreements and other contractual instru-\\nments. For volumes of purchased electricity that are not covered by \\ncontractual instruments, Continental purchases energy attribute cer-\\ntificates that comply with the specified quality criteria. This key ac-\\ntion is implemented by the respective legal entities in close coopera-\\ntion with the central purchasing and environmental departments \\nwho ensure a holistic approach and full coverage of the externally \\npurchased electricity volumes through corresponding instruments. \\nTechnological transformation \\nTechnological transformation takes place within the responsible le-\\ngal entities supported by central functions (e.g. operations or infra-\\nstructure). As part of group sector-specific roadmap implementa-\\ntion programs, suitable concrete measures for the respective loca-\\ntions and production processes, as well as the sequence of their im-\\nplementation at location level are analyzed and decided upon.  \\nAt the tire plant in Lousado, Portugal, for example, an electric boiler \\nwas put into operation in 2024 to generate steam required for the \\nproduction processes. Gas, which was previously used as an energy \\nsource for steam generation, was replaced by green electricity. \\nSimilar projects regarding the levers identified for target achieve-\\nment are implemented at various locations if this is technically and \\neconomically feasible. Selection of the projects is part of the gen-\\neral investment process applying generally applicable criteria for \\ndecision-making as well as the allocation of capital. The investment \\nbudget is determined as part of financial planning. In the event of a \\npositive investment decision, the necessary financial resources are \\nthus made available for the project.  \\nThe metrics for the achieved and expected GHG emissions reduc-\\ntions as a result of the implementation of such projects are set out \\nin the tables below. \\nAchieved GHG reduction \\n2024 \\nScope 1 and market-based Scope 2 GHG reduction achieved,  \\nin million tCO2e \\n0.217 \\n \\n \\nDefinitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: \\n- The metric is calculated as the difference between the Scope 1 and market-based \\nScope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the base year of the Decarbonization \\nRoadmap 2040 (2021) and the Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions \\nat the end of the reporting year. \\n- The data is collected by the individual locations.

Furthermore, the management ap-\\nproaches to Scope 3 emissions, portfolio resilience and transition, \\nare highly important for Continental’s transition towards carbon \\nneutrality.  \\nThe key elements of the transition plan, such as the target (see sub-\\nsection Targets related to climate change), the key actions (see sub-\\nsection Key actions for target achievement) and the management \\napproaches (see subsections Management approaches to climate \\nchange mitigation, climate change adaptation, energy efficiency \\nand renewable energy) have been approved by the Executive \\nBoard of the Continental Group. \\nContinental is of the opinion that the reduction target for Scope 1 \\nand market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions as one of the key ele-\\nments of the transition plan is in line with the Paris Agreement and \\na 1.5°C pathway (see subsection Targets related to climate change). \\nContinental has no knowledge of being exempt from the EU Paris-\\naligned benchmarks. \\nTo achieve the set GHG emission reduction target, Continental has \\nidentified two primary decarbonization levers (see subsection Tar-\\ngets related to climate change), which are addressed by the de-\\nfined actions (see subsection Key actions for target achievement). \\nFurthermore, levers for Scope 3 emissions are operationalized by \\nthe described management approaches. \\nFor a detailed description of the actions and associated metrics \\nthat provide information regarding the progress of the implementa-\\ntion of the transition plan, see subsection Key actions for target \\nachievement. \\nAs part of the IRO assessment (see subsection Overview of mate-\\nrial impacts, risks and opportunities in the General disclosures \\n(ESRS 2) section), Continental analyzed the potential locked-in GHG \\nemissions in the key assets. The conclusion from the analysis was \\nthat, due to their insignificance, they do not jeopardize the achieve-\\nment of the defined GHG emissions reduction target and do not \\nfoster any transition risks. The identified levers for achieving the \\nemissions reduction target are applicable to all assets and are in \\nline with the overarching ambition of achieving carbon neutrality in \\nown operations by 2040. \\nThe sustainability strategy and Decarbonization Roadmap 2040 \\nare integral parts of the overall business strategy and play a key \\nrole in transitioning to a more sustainable business model.

To incentivize the transition \\nto carbon neutrality, Continental has created the option for its legal \\nentities to take internal CO2 shadow prices into account as a sup-\\nporting factor in investment decision-making processes.

Only the goods and \\nservices relevant for category 1 according to the GHG Protocol are considered, \\nincluding all upstream emissions (cradle-to-gate). \\n- Emissions for goods are calculated on a weight basis and for services on a cost basis. \\nThe emission factors of Sphera Solutions GmbH or internally determined group \\nsector-specific and business area-specific GHG factors are used to calculate the \\nemissions. \\n- For purchased product groups for which not all weight data is available, the missing \\nproportion is extrapolated using the average method. The expenditures for services \\nare multiplied either by the specific emission factors from DEFRA or by an internally \\ndetermined emission factor. Within this expenditure-based method, the data is \\nextrapolated for a small share. \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – capital goods \\n- Capital goods that are purchased in the reporting year are considered. \\n- The expenditures for capital goods are multiplied either by the specific emission \\nfactors from DEFRA or by an internally determined emission factor. As part of this \\nexpenditure-based method, the data for a small share is extrapolated.  \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – energy and fuel-related activities \\n(not included in Scopes 1 and 2) \\n- Energy- and fuel-related activities are defined as extraction, production, \\ntransportation, and transportation losses of purchased fuels and energy that are not \\ncovered by Scope 1 or Scope 2. \\n- For energy consumption, the specific emission factors from DEFRA are used within \\nthe framework of an average data method. \\n- The country-specific power grid emission factors are calculated based on the DEFRA \\ncalculation method. For this category, well-to-tank emission factors are considered. \\n- An average transmission loss of 5 % as recommended by DEFRA for steam and \\ndistrict heat is applied. \\n- In the case of renewable electricity, it is assumed that the mix consists of 50 % \\nphotovoltaics and 50 % wind power. \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – upstream transportation and \\ndistribution \\n- Upstream transportation and distribution are defined as the transportation of goods \\nfrom direct suppliers to the company as well as within the company and to the \\ncustomer, if paid for by the company and using third-party vehicles and facilities, \\nincluding emissions from transportation services. \\n- For this category, average data, costs and GHG data from service providers are \\napplied using the distance-based method, with the missing share extrapolated. \\n- Apart from CO2 data from service providers, the emissions for each mode of \\ntransport (road, rail, sea, and air) were determined through calculations, whereby a \\nsmall proportion of the transport modes are estimated. \\n- The basis for calculation includes logistics expenses, weight distance and transport \\nequipment multiplied by the specific emission factors from Sphera Solutions GmbH \\nor DEFRA. \\n- The emissions of the ContiTech group sector are primarily calculated based on the \\nGHG data from service providers. \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – waste generated in operations \\n- Waste generation is multiplied by specific emission factors from DEFRA using an \\naverage data method for different waste categories, only considering emissions \\nassociated with landfill sites and incinerators. \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – business travel \\n- Travel booking service providers report GHG emissions for business trips. Hotel \\novernight stays are included as optional data. The various travel options are also \\nconsidered and calculated. \\n- Some of these external primary data refer to emission factors from DEFRA or vehicle \\nmanufacturers. \\n- Business travel that may not have been booked through these service providers is \\nconsidered by an estimate based on an expert assumption. \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – employee commuting \\n- Daily commuting time and modes of transport are based on an external global \\nsurvey. \\n- For this average-data method, the emissions are calculated on the basis of the \\nestimated commuting distance, effective number of working days and the number of \\nemployees together with the DEFRA emission factors. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n141\\n  \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – upstream leased assets \\n- Continental AG is using management control as a consolidation approach. Therefore, \\nthere are no Scope 3 emissions allocated to leased assets. These are only reported \\nunder Scopes 1 and 2. \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – downstream transportation and \\ndistribution \\n- Downstream transportation and distribution are defined as emissions from the \\ntransportation and distribution of products after the point of sale, including retail and \\nstorage. \\n- The logistics paid for by the customers are extrapolated from Continental’s own \\noutbound logistics emissions from “Upstream transportation and distribution”, based \\non the share of selfpickers determined by total sales or product weight.  \\n- The emission factors from the “Upstream transportation and distribution” category \\nare applied. \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – processing of products sold \\n- Processing of sold products covers the processing of intermediate products sold in \\nthe reporting year to downstream companies. \\n- For the Automotive and ContiTech group sectors, the calculation only considers \\nemissions that are related to the material handling and general assembly stages of \\nContinental products. Taking the product weight sold and the average vehicle weight \\nbased on market data, a virtual vehicle quantity is modeled in this average-data \\nmethod. This virtual vehicle quantity is multiplied by the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG \\nemissions per vehicle manufactured by selected automotive manufacturers. \\n- The calculation model used in the Tires group sector considers the energy \\nconsumption per tire assembly, which was determined by measurements and \\ncalculations for passenger car and truck tires in various processing steps. \\n- The calculation relates exclusively to Continental’s vehicle business. The industrial \\nbusiness within the ContiTech group sector and the trading business of the Tires and \\nAutomotive group sectors are not included, as these emissions are not considered \\nrelevant in terms of their magnitude. \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – use of sold products \\n- This category includes the indirect emissions from the ContiTech and Tires group \\nsectors during the use phase, which are optional to be reported according to the \\nGHG Protocol. For the Automotive group sector, some products, particularly \\nelectronic products, consume electricity during their use phase and could be \\nclassified as direct emissions from the use phase. For this category, tank-to-wheel \\nemission factors are used. \\n- Indirect emissions in the retail business of the Automotive group sector and parts of \\nthe specialty tires, non-tire products and products in the retail business of Tires group \\nsector as well as the industrial business of the ContiTech group sector, except for the \\nconveyor belt business, are not included in the calculation.  \\n- For the Automotive and ContiTech group sectors, the calculation method is based on \\nthe expected product service life as stated by selected automotive manufacturers \\nand the sold product weight, applying average-data methods with emission factors \\nfrom ICCT and DEFRA. \\n- To calculate ContiTech group sector conveyor belt use phase emissions, an average \\nbelt weight, related idle power load, belt runtime per year and lifetime are assessed \\nbased on internal data and expert assessments. \\n- The Tires group sector calculation model is based on tire-industry aligned “Product \\nCategory Rules” (PCR). The energy consumption of sold tires is calculated by \\nconsidering rolling resistance and acceleration resistance. \\n- Furthermore, fuel-specific emission factors from DEFRA, which are based on the PCR \\npowertrain mix in the respective markets, are used for the Tires group sector. \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – end-of-life treatment of sold \\nproducts \\n- Waste disposal and treatment of sold products at the end of their life cycle are \\nconsidered. \\n- The weight of the sold products is multiplied by the specific emission factors from \\nSphera Solutions GmbH in accordance with the disposal and recycling type. In the \\nabsence of weight information for individual product groups, emissions are \\ncalculated based on information on purchased goods. \\n- Internal expert assessments and industrial data are used in the classification of the \\ndisposal and recycling type.  \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – downstream leased assets \\n- Downstream leased assets are defined as the operation of assets owned by Conti-\\nnental that are leased to other companies during the reporting year, excluding those \\nthat are included in the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions reported by the lessor. \\n- This category is calculated using an average-data method. \\n- The size of the leased assets is multiplied by the country- and asset-specific emission \\nfactors from PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials). \\n- The leased equipment (e.g. machinery) are multiplied by a specific emission factor \\nfrom DEFRA. \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – franchises \\n- Using an average-data method, the number of franchise locations is multiplied by the \\ninternally determined energy consumption and the specific emission factors from \\nDEFRA. \\n \\nCalculated indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions – investments \\n- For this category, emissions are calculated using an average-data method. \\n- The sales of at-equity-accounted investees in financial reporting are multiplied by the \\nportion of Continental’s financial contribution with own GHG emissions (calculated \\nbased on Continental’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) per euro of sales. \\n- In cases where sales figures are not available, GHG emissions are extrapolated based \\non the number of reporting companies. \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n142\\n  \\nTotal GHG emissions,  \\nin t CO2e \\nRetrospective \\nMilestones and target years \\nBase year \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n∆ PY in % \\n2025 \\n2030 \\n2035 \\nReduction rate \\n(Annual % target \\n/ Base year) \\nTotal location-based  \\nGHG emissions \\n— \\n— \\n101,514,749 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\nTotal market-based  \\nGHG emissions \\n— \\n— \\n100,251,479 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\nDefinitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: \\n- The total location-based GHG emissions include the GHG emissions from Scope 1, \\nlocation-based Scope 2, and Scope 3. \\n- The total market-based GHG emissions are composed of Scope 1, market-based \\nScope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions. \\n- The figures are calculated in accordance with the assumptions and methods lined out \\nin the corresponding tables for Scope 1 and Scope 2 as well as Scope 3 GHG \\nemissions. \\n \\nScope 3 emissions using primary data \\n2024 \\nShare of Scope 3 GHG emissions calculated using primary data, in % \\n0.01 \\n \\n \\n \\nDefinitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: \\n- Only emissions for which primary data were available in the form of an externally \\nverified product carbon footprint are considered. \\n- Scope 3 GHG emissions calculated based on primary data are considered.

Therefore, Continental’s direct and indirect \\nsuppliers along the supply chain comprise industries which po-\\ntentially have significant negative environmental impacts related \\nto the generation of pollutants in air, water and soil (e.g. from \\nmanufacturing processes of basic materials). (see ESRS 2, IRO \\ntable, impact 18). \\n› Continental buys numerous products and services from a global \\nsupplier base. Therefore, Continental’s direct and indirect suppliers \\noperate in industries and certain markets which might be subject \\n› to major transformation and new regulatory requirements related \\nto the pollution of air, water and soil (especially considering bans \\nor restrictions of certain materials). This can in particular lead to \\nsignificantly higher costs for materials, components and/or ser-\\nvices in the medium term, if not managed preventively. (see  \\nESRS 2, IRO table, risk 23) \\nProduct-related aspects regarding environmental protection \\n› In the use phase of Continental’s products in vehicles and indus-\\ntrial applications, substantive direct and indirect air, water and soil \\nemissions are generated, especially exhaust emissions of vehicles, \\ntire and road wear particles as well as brake dust emissions. (see \\nESRS 2, IRO table, impact 19) \\n› Continental operates in certain markets and industries where sub-\\nstantive emissions to air, water and soil occur during the use \\nphase of Continental’s products. In a scenario with steadily more \\nstringent regulations, the risk of violating these regulations could \\nincrease significantly. Therefore, if not sufficiently anticipated and \\npreventively managed, Continental could be exposed to sanc-\\ntions regimes with significant fines and penalties or even busi-\\nness on hold for the respective business operation, especially in \\nthe medium term.

These also include measures and processes to prevent \\nor, if necessary, mitigate the identified potential negative impacts \\nfrom possible releases into air, water and soil. As publicly stated in \\nContinental’s policy on environment, safety and health (Environ-\\nment, Safety and Health Policy, “ESH Policy”), we conserve re-\\nsources and prevent pollution caused by emission into the air, wa-\\nter and soil. \\nContinental’s management approach for environmental protection \\nmeasures covers own operations worldwide and is especially fo-\\ncused on the production sites. \\nResponsibility for the implementation of environmental protection \\nmeasures and pollution prevention lies with the management of \\nContinental's respective legal entities. The internal framework for \\nenvironmental protection is defined by the environmental depart-\\nments of Continental and supervised by the Executive Board and \\nthe group sector boards. \\nThe processes and monitoring regarding the prevention and con-\\ntainment of environmental incidents are integrated into the overall \\nenvironmental management system. The preventive measures are \\nimplemented on a site-specific basis and include, among others, \\nemergency plans, site inspections by the local ESH managers as \\nwell as regular maintenance plans. Other measures are imple-\\nmented where they are needed and include, for example, hazard-\\nous substance storage, excavation, separators, wastewater treat-\\nment and retention basins. \\nThe prevention and containment of environmental incidents or re-\\nleases includes site-specific emergency plans that control and limit \\nthe impact on people and the environment in case of an actual re-\\nlease. \\nContinental’s environmental management framework, including the \\nprevention and containment of environmental incidents, consists of \\nthe public ESH Policy and the related environmental “responsible \\nvalue chain commitments (RVC commitments)” as well as several \\ninternal rules at different levels of the organization. \\nContinental’s environmental management including the prevention \\nand containment of environmental incidents, such as leakages, is \\nbased on the international environmental management standard \\nISO 14001. Coverage with certified environmental management \\nsystems can be found in the corresponding metric in this section.  \\nWhere relevant, local environmental management also includes a \\nconsultation with local stakeholders like authorities, employees or \\ncommunities. \\nContinental's ESH Policy as well as the associated environment-re-\\nlated RVC commitments are communicated externally on our web-\\nsite. In addition, training materials, other guidance documents and \\nemergency response plans are available for company-internal com-\\nmunication purposes. \\n \\nEnvironmental protection in the supply chain \\nFor environmental protection in the supply chain, Continental has \\ndefined a management approach to prevent and reduce potential \\nnegative environmental impacts related to pollutant emissions to \\nair, water and soil in the supply chain. As stated in our Business \\nPartner Code of Conduct and RVC commitments, Continental ex-\\npects its suppliers to maintain adequate environmental protection \\nmanagement procedures, including, but not limited to air quality, \\nresponsible chemical management, soil protection and the protec-\\ntion of water bodies. \\nContinental’s management approach applies to all of the purchas-\\ning activities of Continental and its subsidiaries worldwide. The fo-\\ncus of the management approach is on the direct suppliers (includ-\\ning service providers), who in turn should pass on the requirements \\nto their suppliers. Additional specifics of the management approach \\napply to the natural rubber supply chain including the deeper sup-\\nply chain in relation to natural rubber sourcing. See also the man-\\nagement approach to responsible sourcing and upstream value \\nchains in the Biodiversity and ecosystems (ESRS E4) section. \\nThe management approach is primarily implemented by Conti-\\nnental’s purchasing departments, which are supported by the envi-\\nronmental and sustainability functions. This is overseen by the Re-\\nsponsible Value Chain Due Diligence System (RVCDDS), including \\noversight by the Executive Board (see also the management ap-\\nproach for workers in the value chain in the Workers in the value \\nchain (ESRS S2) section). \\nThe RVCDDS comprises a variety of processes covering strategy \\ndevelopment and implementation, regulations management, man-\\nagement of potential impacts and incident management (including \\ncomplaints) as well as training. A multi-stage process comprising \\nthree lines has been set up to control and oversee system effi-\\nciency: In terms of the supply chain, the first line comprises the im-\\nplementation of operational tasks at the level of the individual pur-\\nchasing functions. The second line, represented by non-operational \\ngovernance departments and roles, oversees the system, roles and \\nresponsibilities as well as their effectiveness. The third line is repre-\\nsented by the internal audit function which performs an independ-\\nent evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the RVCDDS. \\n\", \" \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n149\\nThe operational tasks include specific preventive and remedial \\nmeasures regarding the supply chain, e.g. alignment of procure-\\nment strategies and practices, definition of contractual agreements \\nand implementation of control mechanisms as well as training of \\npurchasers and suppliers. Selected suppliers are assessed on the \\nbasis of various criteria using self-assessment questionnaires ob-\\ntained via the generally accepted sustainability platforms for our in-\\ndustries, such as EcoVadis and NQC. In addition, selective on-site \\naudits or other audit activities are also carried out, for example in \\nrelation to the existence of environmental management systems. \\nAs part of an annual review process, the Executive Board of Conti-\\nnental AG is updated on the current status by Continental’s human \\nrights officer and assesses the system’s effectiveness, adequacy \\nand potential for improvement. The RVCDDS is additionally inte-\\ngrated into Continental’s overarching internal control system, the \\nrisk management system and compliance management system. \\nThe expectations of suppliers with regard to appropriate environ-\\nmental protection also include the prevention of incidents and \\nemergency situations. \\nThe outlined processes are defined by an environment-related RVC \\ncommitment. Further relevant rules of this internal framework in-\\nclude dedicated rules for purchasing and the associated work in-\\nstructions, which guide the consistent application of the key pro-\\ncesses in all of the company’s businesses and in supplier relations. \\nDirect suppliers are guided by the binding Business Partner Code \\nof Conduct (BPCoC), which also refers to the RVC commitments. \\nFor suppliers of natural rubber, Continental’s purchasing policy for \\nsustainable natural rubber also applies. \\nContinental's management approach to environmental protection \\nis guided by Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferket-\\ntensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG) as well as other due diligence \\nstandards such as the UN Guiding Principles and the OECD Guide-\\nlines.  \\nThe interests of stakeholders, such as customers and associations, \\nare taken into account within the management processes. \\nContinental communicates its management approach through its \\nPublic Policy Statement and externally published RVC commit-\\nments. Supplier training initiatives are also carried out to further \\npromote awareness and shared responsibility across the entire \\nvalue chain. In addition, direct suppliers are requested to sign the \\nBusiness Partner Code of Conduct. Communication is therefore \\naimed at both stakeholders and suppliers. \\nProduct-related aspects regarding environmental protection \\nContinental has anchored in its sustainability ambition to strive for \\nemission-free mobility and industry together with its partners along \\nthe value chain by 2050 at the latest. In this context, “emission-\\nfree” means the complete mitigation of harmful emissions (such as \\ngreenhouse gases or nitrogen oxides (NOx)). It does not include \\nharmless emissions like water vapor emissions, non-toxic, biode-\\ngradable particle emissions or minimal noise emissions. \\nAccordingly, Continental has implemented a specific management \\napproach to support the transition of our industries, reduce nega-\\ntive environmental impacts in the product use phase, ensure regu-\\nlatory compliance and at the same time support opportunities for \\ngrowth in specific business activities. \\nWith regard to tire and road wear particles and brake dust in partic-\\nular, Continental is working on researching open issues relating to \\nthese non-tailpipe-related emissions and their generation, composi-\\ntion, transport and fate in the environment. Continental is helping \\nto expand the base of scientifically sound knowledge about the im-\\npacts on human health and the environment, as the impacts have \\nstill not been sufficiently researched. \\nIt should therefore be noted that, according to current knowledge, \\ntire and road wear will always occur in order to enable controllable \\nand safe acceleration and braking as well as stable cornering. Ef-\\nforts are therefore being made to reduce wear particles from tires \\non the one hand, and to make them as environmentally friendly as \\npossible on the other. \\nThe management approach focuses on products that contribute to \\nthe reduction of relevant emissions, in particular tailpipe emissions, \\ntire and road wear particles and brake dust emissions. \\nResponsibility for expanding the business with zero-tailpipe-emis-\\nsion vehicles (ZTEV) and for the implementation of measures to re-\\nduce emissions, compliance with legal requirements and economic \\naspects lies with the respective business. They are supported by \\nvarious central departments, including product development, sus-\\ntainability, technical compliance and quality. Oversight is ultimately \\nprovided by the group sector boards as well as the Executive Board \\nof the Continental Group. \\nThe general processes of the management approach include, for \\nexample, market research, activities in the area of research and de-\\nvelopment, active portfolio management and close dialogue with \\ncustomers – as also described in the Climate change (ESRS E1) sec-\\ntion in the subsection on Management approaches to climate \\nchange mitigation, climate change adaptation, energy efficiency \\nand renewable energy under Scope 3 emissions, portfolio resili-\\nence and transition. Increasing business with ZTEV components \\nand systems contributes to reducing tailpipe emissions in the use \\nphase. \\n\", ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n150\\nThe management processes regarding zero tailpipe emissions such \\nas tire and road wear particles as well as brake dust comprise, in \\nparticular, R&D activities and cooperations in industry associations \\nand with universities, science and customers in order to continue \\nexpanding the comprehensive understanding of the generation of \\ntire and road wear particles as well as brake dust and their behavior \\nin the environment. This includes also working on international \\nstandards for the measurement of particulate matter, e.g. within the \\nframe of the UNECE. One example of a cooperation in the area of \\ntire and road wear particles is the joint research project between \\nContinental, the University of Southern Denmark and the Ecole \\nNormale Supérieure de Lyon to research the degradation of rubber \\npolymers in the environment. \\nFurthermore, in R&D and product development processes (e.g. the \\nproduct life cycle management), Continental investigates and de-\\nvelops further technical developments and solutions designed to \\ncontinuously reduce these emissions more and more, and to en-\\nsure compliance with the increasingly stringent regulations. The \\nproduct development processes also include working on the eco-\\nnomic feasibility, market readiness and scaling of such solutions as \\nwell as the cooperation with customers, suppliers and other parties \\n(e.g. universities). One example of basic research in the area of \\nbrake dust was the LOWBRASYS project, which was completed in \\n2019. The project assessed various technologies that could signifi-\\ncantly reduce brake dust. \\nWith regard to tire and road wear particles, Continental’s develop-\\nment engineers and material experts are working, in particular, on \\nmodifying both the tire design and the composition of tire com-\\npounds in order to reduce the impacts on the environment without \\ncompromising on the safety-related properties of the tires. The pro-\\ncesses are similar for brake dust particles, with material and prod-\\nuct development also involving cooperation with the suppliers of \\nthe relevant components such as brake pads and brake discs. \\nThe compliance of products with applicable standards, customer \\nrequirements and regulations is also subject to Continental’s tech-\\nnical compliance processes and quality management systems. \\nAdvances in these processes can also help Continental to generate \\ncompetitive advantages in the medium term in a surrounding of \\nchanging product requirements, and to exploit growth and margin \\nopportunities, particularly for components and systems for zero-\\ntailpipe-emission vehicles and for tires and braking systems. \\nAs a result of the IROs, specific processes for incidents and emer-\\ngency situations in the downstream value chain are not relevant. \\nThe management approaches are guided by Continental’s tech-\\nnical compliance framework and the sustainability ambition. Fur-\\nther internal rules on specific business processes apply. \\nCurrent and upcoming international technical standards, obliga-\\ntions and regulations regarding pollution (e.g. Euro 7) are relevant \\nand binding for Continental’s products and measurements (such as \\nthe UN Global Technical Regulation No. 24 for brake emissions).  \\nTo ensure compliant products and to reduce pollution, Continental \\nmaintains active dialogue with stakeholders such as authorities, \\ncustomers, science and industry associations, as well as industry \\nassociations and initiatives (such as the European Association of \\nAutomotive Suppliers (CLEPA), the European Tyre & Rubber Manu-\\nfacturers Association (ETRMA), and the U.S. Tire Manufacturers As-\\nsociation (USTMA)). Of particular note is the cooperation between \\ntire manufacturers and the World Business Council for Sustainable \\nDevelopment (WBCSD) on the subject of tire abrasion as part of the \\n“Tire Industry Project” (TIP). \\nOne important element of the communication on topics regarding \\nnon-tailpipe-related emissions in the use phase is the joint commu-\\nnication via industry projects (e.g. TIP) or associations. \\n \\nSubstances of concern and very high concern \\nContinental has implemented a management approach for sub-\\nstances of concern and very high concern to ensure the safe usage \\nof these chemicals, protect employees and environment and be \\ncompliant with regulations, and to gradually substitute them with \\nmore sustainable chemicals. \\nAs outlined in Continental’s sustainability ambition for “clean and \\nsafe factories” and in our ESH policy, preventive measures are \\ntaken, hazards are eliminated and risks are reduced. \\nOur framework to substitute and minimize the use of substances of \\nconcern in own operations specifies that hazardous chemicals \\nshould be evaluated if a less hazardous alternative or substitute is \\navailable.  \\nThe management approach regarding substances of concern in \\nthe supply chain is largely covered by the management approach \\nfor environmental protection in the supply chain. Our Business \\nPartner Code of Conduct also includes the expectation that our \\nbusiness partners will manage all chemicals responsibly. \\nContinental’s hazardous substances management covers own op-\\nerations worldwide and is especially focused on production sites. It \\nalso partially encompasses aspects in the upstream and down-\\nstream value chain. The management approach covers both sub-\\nstances of concern and substances of very high concern. \\n', \" \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n151\\nResponsibility for the implementation of the management ap-\\nproach for substances of concern lies with the management of \\nContinental's respective legal entities. The governance framework \\nfor the management of hazardous substances is defined in particu-\\nlar by the departments for environment, safety and health as well \\nas product development, overseen by the Executive Board of Conti-\\nnental AG and the group sector boards. \\nThe processes for monitoring the management of hazardous sub-\\nstances are integrated into the overall environmental and occupa-\\ntional health & safety management system as described in the \\nmanagement approaches to Environmental protection in own oper-\\nations in this section as well as Occupational safety and health in \\nthe Own workforce (ESRS S1) section. Preventive measures for sub-\\nstances of concern are implemented site-specifically and include \\nthe identification of hazardous substances, maintenance of hazard-\\nous substance inventories and ensuring the safe usage and storage \\nof chemicals. \\nContinental’s processes for substances of concern also include \\nsome upstream and downstream value chain aspects, e.g. with re-\\ngard to integration into general procurement processes, approval \\nof use and restrictions of use of substances which are procured, \\nproduct and process development as well as placing compliant and \\nsafe products on the markets (see also the management approach \\nto Technical and product compliance in the Consumers and end-\\nusers (ESRS S4) section). The implementation of these rules is regu-\\nlarly reviewed, for example within internal ESH-audits. \\nThe framework for Continental’s management regarding sub-\\nstances of concern consists of a set of environmental, occupational \\nhealth & safety rules at different levels of the organization as well as \\nthe sustainability ambition, ESH policy and the corresponding RVC \\ncommitments. \\nThe environmental, occupational health & safety management sys-\\ntems are based on the international standards ISO 14001 and ISO \\n45001, which are also standards for the management of hazard-\\nous substances. Furthermore, Continental follows the Minamata \\nConvention on Mercury, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent \\nOrganic Pollutants (POPs) as well as the Global Automotive Declara-\\nble Substance List (GADSL) and the International Material Data Sys-\\ntem (IMDS) for our automotive products. \\nContinental involves relevant stakeholders in its environmental, oc-\\ncupational health & safety management, which also includes con-\\nsultations with local stakeholders such as authorities, employees \\nand communities. \\nContinental’s ESH policy as well as the sustainability ambitions are \\ncommunicated externally on our website. In addition, training mate-\\nrials and other guidance documents (such as emergency response \\nplans) are available for company-internal communications pur-\\nposes. Continental communicates and trains the implementation of \\nthe rules via environmental, safety and health (EHS) managers \\nwithin the group sectors. \\nTargets Related to Pollution \\nContinental has defined a systematic process for setting targets. With \\nregard to pollution, it was decided to pursue the management ap-\\nproaches described and not to set a time-bound sustainability target. \\nThe monitoring of effectiveness and the tracking of progress is de-\\nscribed in the related management approaches and reported metrics. \\nKey Actions for Target Achievement \\nIn Continental’s view, key actions to be reported relate directly to \\ncorresponding targets, where available.

The general disclosures in-\\nclude an overview of the assessment of all identified impacts, risks \\nand opportunities (IROs), including the time horizons considered. \\nIn this IRO assessment, the following material potential and actual \\nnegative impacts, risks and opportunities have been identified in re-\\nlation to biodiversity and ecosystems. They have been grouped \\ninto IRO clusters for easier understanding and reading. The descrip-\\ntions of the negative impacts and risks are presented from a gross \\nperspective which, on the basis of applied methodology, does not \\ntake into account mitigation through the management approaches \\nof Continental as described in the respective IRO cluster. This per-\\nspective is used to determine where appropriate management ap-\\nproaches are relevant and corresponding reporting is required. As \\nopportunities are strengthened by Continental’s management ap-\\nproaches, the descriptions are presented taking a net perspective \\nwhich, for methodical reasons, considers the results of the manage-\\nment approaches. \\nThe descriptions of the IROs are to be regarded as self-contained, \\nwhich may result in repetitions. \\nResponsible purchasing and upstream value chain \\n› Continental is highly dependent on natural rubber to manufac-\\nture its rubber products. The production of natural rubber in gen-\\neral is considered a key commodity regarding potential deforesta-\\ntion. Beyond natural rubber, deforestation is also generally consid-\\nered a relevant issue in other supply chains (e.g. metals). It can \\ntherefore be assumed that deforestation can occur deeper in \\nContinental’s supply chain if not managed preventively. (see ESRS \\n2, IRO table, impact 28) \\n› Continental as well as its direct and indirect suppliers operate \\namong others in industries and certain markets that are actually \\nor potentially subject to regulation related to deforestation and \\nthe resulting market transition. This can lead to significantly \\nhigher costs for materials, components or services, if not man-\\naged preventively. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 31) \\n› Continental buys numerous products and services from a global \\nsupplier base. Therefore, Continental’s direct and indirect suppli-\\ners operate in certain markets and industries that pose a risk of \\npotential deforestation, particularly in relation to natural rubber. If \\ncorrective measures are not taken and due diligence measures \\nare not performed or serious violations occur, Continental can be \\nexposed to sanction regulations with substantial penalties and \\nfines or even business on hold for the respective business opera-\\ntion, especially in the medium term. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk \\n30) \\n› Continental operates in certain markets and industries and pro-\\ncures numerous products and services from a global supplier \\nbase which must comply with increasing regulatory requirements \\nwith regard to biodiversity. Comprehensive preventive measures \\nfor securing access to supply chains that are prepared for fast in-\\ncreasing regulation on biodiversity due diligence might poten-\\ntially create comparatively more resilient supply chains offering \\nsignificant potential for differentiation from the competition in the \\nmedium term. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, opportunity 32) \\nDownstream value chain \\n› Continental provides components and systems for vehicles and \\nindustrial applications. In the use phase of vehicles and industrial \\napplications as well as in the provision of the related infrastruc-\\ntures (e.g. roads and mines), significant direct and indirect nega-\\ntive impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems (particularly climate \\nchange, pollution and changes in land use) occur. These are pri-\\nmarily indirectly related to the individual companies in the vehicle \\nand industrial value chains.\\u2009(see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 29)  \\n \\n \\nBiodiversity and Ecosystems (ESRS E4) \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n155\\nFurther Information on the IRO Assessment in Relation to Biodiversity and \\nEcosystems \\nContinental has no locations in own operations that have a signifi-\\ncant impact on biodiversity and ecosystems. \\nContinental has no material negative impacts with regards to land \\ndegradation, desertification or soil sealing. \\nContinental has no locations in the vicinity of habitats of endan-\\ngered species that have significant negative impacts on them. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nManagement Approaches to Biodiversity and Ecosystems \\nContinental has implemented management approaches that ad-\\ndress the impacts, risks, dependencies and opportunities related to \\nbiodiversity and ecosystems. \\nThe management approaches explicitly address the issue of defor-\\nestation in the upstream value chain.  \\nThe management approaches do not address sustainable practices \\nin connection with the oceans or seas, as no associated material \\nimpacts, risks, dependencies or opportunities have been identified. \\n \\nResponsible purchasing and upstream value chain \\nContinental’s management approach for responsible purchasing \\nand upstream value chain addresses two material drivers of biodi-\\nversity loss in the supply chain: pollution and deforestation. \\nFor the pollution driver, Continental has implemented a manage-\\nment approach to avoid and reduce potential negative environ-\\nmental impacts related to the generation of pollutants in air, water \\nand soil in the supply chain. This management approach is de-\\nscribed in the subsection Environmental protection in the supply \\nchain in the Pollution (ESRS E2) section.  \\nIn addition, Continental has implemented a management approach \\nto prevent the loss of biodiversity through deforestation, particu-\\nlarly through the cultivation of natural rubber, and to comply with \\nthe regulatory requirements for deforestation-free supply chains.  \\nAs part of responsible purchasing, Continental indirectly addresses \\nthe driver of biodiversity loss, in particular change in land use in \\nconnection with deforestation. \\nIn addition, the management approach addresses Continental’s  \\ndependence on natural rubber. In 2018, Continental introduced a \\n“Sustainable Natural Rubber Sourcing Policy” to ensure responsible \\npurchasing. The purchasing policy has been integrated into the \\nbusiness processes and decision-making processes, risk manage-\\nment and processes for risk mitigation. By implementing this man-\\nagement approach, Continental is able to increase the resilience of \\nthe supply chain while addressing the risks associated with the EU \\nDeforestation Regulation (EUDR) and subsequent market changes. \\nThe social consequences of the impacts on biodiversity associated \\nwith deforestation are given special consideration in the manage-\\nment approach. \\nSustainable or agricultural practices are addressed in the Sustaina-\\nble Natural Rubber Sourcing Policy. \\nContinental’s management approach for responsible purchasing fo-\\ncuses on direct suppliers and indirectly on the deeper supply chain. \\nContinental expects its direct suppliers to cascade the principles \\nthrough their respective supply chains. Regarding sustainable natu-\\nral rubber, the management approach explicitly covers the supply \\nchain down to the rubber plantation.  \\nResponsibility for the management approach to environmental pro-\\ntection is described in the corresponding subsection in the Pollu-\\ntion (ESRS E2) section under Environmental protection in the sup-\\nply chain. Responsibility for the implementation of the manage-\\nment approach regarding the responsible purchasing of natural \\nrubber lies with the respective purchasing departments, which are \\nsupported e.g. by the sustainability departments. Strategic monitor-\\ning is the responsibility of the group sector boards and, at an over-\\narching level, the Executive Board of the Continental Group.\\u2009 \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n156\\nContinental requires its business partners in the natural rubber sup-\\nply chain to comply with the Sustainable Natural Rubber Sourcing \\nPolicy in their own operations and further expects them to adhere \\nto these principles throughout their entire value chain. The require-\\nments from supplier obligations can lead to audits and follow-up \\nmeasures, e.g. corrective action plans (CAPs) or other mitigation \\nmeasures. \\nAs part of its joint development partnership with the Deutsche Ge-\\nsellschaft für internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), Continental is \\nconducting training courses directly on site for small farmers in In-\\ndonesia to promote sustainable farming methods. \\nAnother relevant purchasing process is a so-called “risk mapping” \\n(e.g. based on the Rubberway risk analysis and verified self-assess-\\nment procedures), which assesses potential deforestation at vari-\\nous upstream nodes in Continental’s natural rubber supply chain. \\nTo purchase natural rubber from responsible sources, Continental \\nuses the digital trading platform Agridence (formerly HeveaCon-\\nnect). Standardized information on compliance with social and en-\\nvironmental standards, quality criteria and average sales prices can \\nbe viewed transparently on the platform. At the same time, the plat-\\nform offers the opportunity to incorporate information from the \\nanalyses of the Rubberway platform. \\nIn addition, collaboration with industry to improve the methods and \\ncompliance with due diligence is another important process. Conti-\\nnental is a member of the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural \\nRubber (GPSNR). This includes annual reporting on progress and \\nsupports an industry-wide learning approach, which contributes to \\nthe effectiveness of the management approach.\\u2009 \\nAs a potential future lever to reduce some pressure on ecosystems, \\nContinental has established research and development project \\ncalled “Taraxagum”, which investigates and develops the potential \\nof natural rubber from dandelions as a substitute for natural rubber \\nfrom rubber trees in tropical regions. \\nTraceability mechanisms have been implemented to improve, in \\nparticular, understanding and transparency in natural rubber pur-\\nchasing. The Rubberway platform in particular, which was devel-\\noped in an industry collaboration, is used to trace natural rubber \\nback to the natural rubber plantation. \\nThe management approach does not include regular monitoring of \\nbiodiversity status as well as its gains or losses. Nevertheless, Conti-\\nnental takes into account the aspect of responsible sourcing and \\nconsumption from ecosystems, especially with regard to fulfilling \\nhigh conservation standards and sustainable natural rubber cultiva-\\ntion practices.  \\nBeyond the formalization of the overall management approaches in \\ninternal rules, as described in the management approaches to Envi-\\nronmental protection in the supply chain, Continental’s set of rules \\nfor biodiversity in responsible purchasing include the following \\npublic frameworks in particular: \\n› Sustainable Natural Rubber Sourcing Policy,\\u2009  \\n› Commitments to a responsible value chain (RVC commitments),\\u2009\\u2009  \\n› Business Partner Code of Conduct. \\nThe management approaches are guided especially by regulatory \\nrequirements for due diligence, such as the German Supply Chain \\nDue Diligence Act (LksG) and EUDR. In addition, the management \\napproach was harmonized with the GPSNR.  \\nThe GPSNR is a platform that brings together different stakeholders \\nand takes into account the interests of its members (from small-\\nholders to natural rubber processors, tire and automotive manufac-\\nturers, as well as civil society organizations). In addition, public con-\\nsultations with non-members are held.  \\nThe policies are communicated externally through our website and \\ninternally via Continental’s various channels. In addition, every new \\nand existing direct supplier is requested to sign the Business Part-\\nner Code of Conduct. \\n \\nDownstream value chain \\nContinental’s management approach to the impacts on biodiversity \\nand ecosystems in the downstream value chain addresses pollu-\\ntion and climate change as key drivers of biodiversity loss. The re-\\nlated management approaches are described in other sections in \\nthis sustainability report. \\n› Scope 3 emissions, portfolio resilience and transition with regard \\nto climate change-related negative impacts on biodiversity and \\necosystems. This management approach addresses climate \\nchange mitigation, energy efficiency and renewable energy de-\\nployment.

There-\\nfore, no specific management approach was defined for the driver \\nchange in the land use. \\nContinental’s management approaches relate to the following di-\\nrect drivers of biodiversity loss listed in ESRS E4, AR4: \\n› Climate change,  \\n› Pollution. \\nContinental has not identified any material risks related to biodiver-\\nsity and ecosystems in the downstream value chain. \\nBiodiversity and ecosystems-related social consequences in the \\ndownstream value chain are not considered separately in the man-\\nagement approaches. \\nAlong the downstream value chain, the traceability of products and \\nthus the product-related impacts are extremely limited due to the \\nnature of the products and are therefore not taken into account in \\nthe management approaches. \\n \\n \\nTargets Related to Biodiversity and Ecosystems \\nContinental has defined a systematic process for setting targets. \\nWith regard to biodiversity and ecosystems, it was decided to pur-\\nsue the defined management approaches and not to set a time-\\nbound sustainability target. The monitoring of effectiveness and the \\ntracking of progress is described in the related management ap-\\nproaches and reported metrics. \\n \\nKey Actions for Target Achievement \\nIn Continental’s view, key actions to be reported relate directly to \\ncorresponding targets, where available. Therefore, in accordance \\nwith this definition, Continental has not defined any key actions in \\nrelation to biodiversity and ecosystems beyond the described man-\\nagement approaches. \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n158\\nConsideration of Biodiversity and Ecosystems in the Strategy and Business Model \\nRelation to strategy and business model \\nThe impacts and risks identified in relation to biodiversity and eco-\\nsystems are by definition related to Continental’s strategy and busi-\\nness model. Integration into Continental’s strategy and business \\nmodel is described in this section in the management approaches \\nResponsible purchasing and upstream value chain as well as Down-\\nstream value chain. \\nIn addition, the analysis of the resilience of Continental’s strategy \\nand business model in relation to biodiversity and ecosystems \\nalong the entire value chain is integrated into the general IRO as-\\nsessment (see subsection Overview of material impacts, risks and \\nopportunities in the General disclosures (ESRS 2) section). \\n \\nResilience of strategy and business model \\nThe focus of the resilience analysis is on the combined transition \\nand systemic risk related to deforestation regulation and has been \\nincorporated into the general IRO assessment. \\nIn the process of identifying and assessing risks and opportunities \\nas part of the general IRO assessment, Continental took into con-\\nsideration several factors and scenarios, as described in the IROs. \\nThe use of scenarios and assumptions by definition leads to uncer-\\ntainties in the outcome of the analysis. To assess the resilience of \\nContinental’s business model to the identified risks and opportunities, \\na net assessment was carried out taking into account the existing \\nmanagement approaches related to biodiversity and ecosystems. \\nBased on the identified risks, the upstream value chain represents \\nthe focus of the resilience analysis. \\nThe key assumptions of the identified risks were the assumed de-\\nvelopment of regulation and market developments, as described in \\nthe respective risks. This includes especially the expected imple-\\nmentation of the EUDR. \\nThe stakeholders were involved in the assessment as described in \\nthe general methodology of the IRO assessment in the subsection \\nOverview of material impacts, risks and opportunities presented in \\nthe General disclosures (ESRS 2) section. \\nContinental has assessed its material risks in relation to biodiversity \\nand ecosystems and especially in relation to deforestation, with a \\nfocus on a medium-term time horizon. \\nBased on the IRO assessment and taking into account the manage-\\nment approaches, Continental considers its business activities to be \\nresilient. The management approaches in relation to biodiversity \\nand ecosystems describe Continental’s current ability to reduce its \\nmaterial negative impacts, manage risks and seize opportunities. \\nContinental also assumes that these skills will continue to develop \\nover time. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n159\\nMaterial Impacts, Risks and Opportunities Related to Resource Use and Circular \\nEconomy \\nContinental assessed its potential and actual negative and positive \\nimpacts as well as risks and opportunities related to sustainability \\naccording to the regulatory requirements and as described in the \\nGeneral disclosures (ESRS 2) section.

They have been \\ngrouped together into IRO clusters for easier understanding and \\nreading. The descriptions of the negative impacts and risks are pre-\\nsented from a gross perspective which, on the basis of applied \\nmethodology, does not take into account mitigation through the \\nmanagement approaches of Continental as described in the re-\\nspective IRO cluster. This perspective is used to determine where \\nappropriate management approaches are relevant and correspond-\\ning reporting is required.

Continental and its direct suppliers and indirect \\nsuppliers along the supply chain also operate in industries and \\ntypes of operations which involve significant sourcing of raw ma-\\nterials from primary or non-renewable sources (including fossil-\\nbased materials and materials from mining). (see ESRS 2, IRO ta-\\nble, impact 33) \\n› Continental buys numerous products and services from a global \\nsupplier base. Therefore, Continental’s direct and indirect suppli-\\ners also operate in industries and specific markets which could be \\nsubject to regulation related to the use of non-renewable respec-\\ntively renewable and non-recycled respectively recycled re-\\nsources as well as the related market transition. This can lead to \\nsignificantly higher costs for materials, components or services \\nespecially in the medium term, if not managed preventively. (see \\nESRS 2, IRO table, risk 36) \\n› Continental operates in industries which are not yet fully circular. \\nThe global product and material cycles for electronic compo-\\nnents, tires, industrial components and other products are only \\npartially closed. Considering the total amount of material in Conti-\\nnental’s products, the related end-of-life-disposal of Continental’s \\nproducts therefore contributes substantively to waste generation. \\n(see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 34) \\n› Continental’s product portfolio serves markets which are trans-\\nforming considerably because of circularity-related regulatory re-\\nquirements and market trends. Related regulatory requirements \\nsuch as climate protection regulations can also be important for \\ncircularity. Given the broadness of Continental’s portfolio, many \\nproduct segments and the business with many customer groups \\ncould face transformational challenges and the speed of change \\ncould exceed the potential speed of adaptation. This could, if not \\nmanaged adequately, lead to a critical loss in sales in the respec-\\ntive business activities, especially in the long term. (see ESRS 2, \\nIRO table, risk 37) \\nWaste in own operations \\n› Continental currently generates non-recyclable waste (including \\nhazardous waste) in own operations, which is sent to landfill or in-\\ncineration plants. This leads to limited negative impacts on circu-\\nlar economy and is therefore considered relevant for corporate \\nresponsibility. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 35) \\n› Continental’s waste management could open up moderate finan-\\ncial opportunities by reducing operational costs, if waste manage-\\nment and waste handling are further improved in the medium \\nterm. This opportunity is considered relevant from an ESRS re-\\nporting perspective. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, opportunity 38) \\n \\n \\nResource Use and Circular Economy (ESRS E5) \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n160\\nManagement Approaches for Resource Use and Circular Economy \\nIn the area of resource use and circular economy, Continental has \\ndeveloped the management approaches Circularity and Waste in \\nown operations in order to manage the described impacts, risks \\nand opportunities. \\n \\nCircularity \\nOur management approach for circularity aims to contribute to \\nContinental’s sustainability ambition and achieve 100 % closed re-\\nsource and product loops by 2050 at the latest. Besides fulfilling \\nthis ambition, this management approach strives to mitigate re-\\nlated risks in the area of circularity considering the different require-\\nments and speeds of transformation of our customers, industries \\nand markets. \\nThe management approach encompasses the upstream and down-\\nstream value chain as well as Continental’s own operations and also \\nincludes switching from the use of primary to secondary resources \\nand materials.  \\nThe procurement of renewable and recycled (secondary) materials \\nis a key element here. \\nThe management approach applies to the entire Group and the \\nproduct portfolio and covers resource inflows and outflows. \\nThe responsible business functions bear the responsibility for the \\nmanagement and adaptation of the respective product portfolio. \\nOversight of the effectiveness of portfolio management is exercised \\nby the group sector boards and the Executive Board of Continental. \\nKey processes are handled by the respective departments within \\nthe company, e.g. research and development (R&D), product de-\\nsign, supply chain management and purchasing. These are sup-\\nported by the sustainability departments.  \\nThe management approach includes specific process regarding re-\\nsource inflows and outflows considering technological, biological \\nand product cycles. For resource inflows, the related key measures \\nregarding purchased resources are mainly managed in purchasing, \\nproduct design and R&D processes. \\nThe process of material approval, managed by R&D, serves among \\nother purposes the identification of recycled and renewable materi-\\nals to be introduced in production processes. The process of mate-\\nrial approval usually consists of a laboratory evaluation, followed by \\ntesting and a processing evaluation before a material is released. \\nThe sourcing of renewable and recycled materials partially includes \\nactive supplier development, which is managed by the purchasing \\ndepartments, as well as the sourcing of materials within traceability \\nmechanisms like the mass balance approach.  \\nIn addition, Continental engages with selected suppliers in strategic \\nsupplier meetings to intensify activities regarding circularity such \\nas through respective adaptation in product design and material \\ncomposition. \\nFor resource outflows, the management approach comprises \\nmeasures with regard to the circularity of products that are mainly \\nmanaged within product design as well as R&D processes, with a \\nfocus on improved reusability, repairability, recyclability, durability \\nand overall circularity. This includes own activities as well as indus-\\ntry cooperations and partnerships.  \\nContinental’s sustainability ambition sets the overarching frame-\\nwork for the definition and implementation of measures. \\nFor the traceability of dedicated materials, Continental applies the \\nISCC PLUS framework as described in more detail in the following \\nsubsections of this section. \\nThe management approach and the related measures take into \\nconsideration in particular the requirements of customers and re-\\nquests of investors. For resource inflows, especially direct suppliers \\nas part of the upstream value chain are directly involved. For re-\\nsource outflows, the perspectives of stakeholders relevant to end-\\nof-life treatment are also taken into account, for example in industry \\ninitiatives.  \\nContinental communicates its approach to managing circularity ex-\\nternally through the publication of the annual report as well as \\ntrade fairs, press releases and dialogues with investors, and inter-\\nnally using various channels such as conferences on sustainability \\nand products, working groups and the company-wide intranet. \\n \\nWaste in own operations \\nTo minimize the negative impact of landfilling or incineration of \\nnon-recyclable waste from own operations and to make the best \\npossible use of opportunities in relation to waste efficiency, Conti-\\nnental has developed a management approach for waste that is in-\\ntegrated into the general environmental management. A defined \\nwaste hierarchy has been introduced at the locations for this pur-\\npose. It prioritizes actions to reduce waste generation, followed by \\nreusing materials, recycling, and recovering energy from waste. The \\nleast preferred option is disposal, such as landfill. By following this \\nhierarchy, we can reduce environmental impact and promote sus-\\ntainable use of resources. Continental strives to gradually reduce \\nthe amount of waste and the generation of waste at its locations \\nstep by step and year by year. Due to the different business activi-\\nties within the company, specific programs are designed by the in-\\ndividual group sectors in line with respective needs.  \\n', \" \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n161\\nThe management approach for waste in own operations covers the \\nentire Continental Group. \\nContinental’s environmental strategy is steered and approved by \\nthe Executive Board. The associated programs are coordinated in \\ninternal committees of the environmental protection departments. \\nThe waste management is embedded in Continental's environmen-\\ntal management systems. \\nWaste-related processes are monitored and continuously improved \\nas part of the general reviews of environmental management. \\nContinental’s environmental management system was developed \\nin accordance with ISO 14001, an internationally recognized standard  \\nfor environmental management systems from the International Or-\\nganization for Standardization (ISO). \\nThe management approach reflects the interests of various stake-\\nholders by using the widely accepted waste hierarchy and the adher-\\nence to ISO 14001. The direct interaction with stakeholders in rela-\\ntion to waste takes place in particular with the responsible authorities. \\nContinental communicates its management approach to waste \\nmanagement through various channels to ensure comprehensive \\nunderstanding and engagement across the entire company. This \\nincludes information on the intranet, which makes the approach \\nand specific internal rules accessible to all employees. \\n \\nTargets Related to Resource Use and Circular Economy \\nAs part of its sustainability ambition in relation to circularity and \\ncarbon neutrality, Continental has set a public sustainability target \\nfor the Tires group sector with regard to recycled and renewable \\nmaterial inflows. Continental has set for itself the target of increas-\\ning the share of recycled and renewable production materials for \\ntires to at least 40 % by 2030. \\nThe target is related to Continental’s management approaches Cir-\\ncularity as noted in this section, and Scope 3 emissions, portfolio \\nresilience and transition in the Climate change (ESRS E1) section of \\nthis sustainability report. The processes of the management ap-\\nproach to circularity in terms of resource inflows are decisive for \\nachieving the defined target. These are focused on resource inflow \\nand enable this target to be achieved, as increased share of recy-\\ncled and renewable materials is expected to lead to a lower carbon \\nfootprint for materials while at the same time enabling closed-loop \\nresource cycles. \\nContinental has identified key levers regarding resource inflows to \\nincrease the share of recycled and renewable tire production mate-\\nrials. These comprise measures on the selection of recycled and re-\\nnewable materials, which are usually managed by R&D, as well as \\nthe identification of new suppliers and the further development of \\nexisting suppliers to secure relevant quantities of recycled and re-\\nnewable materials in the purchasing processes. These are set out in \\nspecific material roadmaps and are regularly updated. Correspond-\\ning certifications of origin or other instruments for origin and trace-\\nability contribute towards achieving the target by making it possi-\\nble to create transparency in the supply chains. \\nTransitioning away from non-renewable resources will be achieved \\nby replacing non-renewable materials with alternatives from renew-\\nable sources. In addition, the replacement of primary materials with \\nmaterials from secondary sources, e.g. from recycling processes, \\ncontribute towards achieving the target. For selecting renewable \\nand recycled materials, the technical ability to integrate these with-\\nout compromising safety and performance into our tires is prereq-\\nuisite. This is ensured in the general process of material approval \\nby R&D through detailed assessments and tests that take into ac-\\ncount the material characteristics, their interdependencies in the \\noverall material composition and the tires as the end product. In \\ngeneral, some materials can be replaced by technically identical al-\\nternatives without changing the material composition or the end \\nproduct, e.g. when a primary material is replaced by the same but \\nrecycled material. In addition, in some cases, replacing materials \\nwith alternative and technically slightly different yet renewable or \\nrecycled materials can lead to smaller differences in the end prod-\\nuct. In doing so, Continental always ensures the same level of prod-\\nuct safety and performance as well as takes further relevant bound-\\nary conditions into account. \\nBased on the materials identified and approved as recycled or re-\\nnewable resource inflow, a joint strategy development process \\ntakes place between purchasing, R&D and sustainability. For materi-\\nals identified with a potential to contribute to the target in a signifi-\\ncant manner, dedicated material roadmaps are developed and \\nmaintained by the purchasing departments. These roadmaps as-\\nsess the general availability of the respective materials for the re-\\nquired quantities and allow conclusive analysis on their availability  \\n\", ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n162\\non the market at economically compatible costs. Securing suffi-\\ncient quantities of these materials is ensured through a balanced \\npurchasing strategy that includes long-term contractual agree-\\nments as well as short-term purchasing activities for flexibility in dy-\\nnamic markets. \\nThe transparency and provision of evidence of the use of renewa-\\nble and recycled materials is a key lever to achieving the set target. \\nAs for many of our highly complex chemical value chains, material \\nflows can hardly be traced physically on one-on-one level. There-\\nfore, Continental also applies the mass balance approach (MBA) to \\npurchases of materials, e.g. within the scope of ISCC PLUS. The pur-\\nchasing departments as well as the sustainability department of \\nthe Tires group sector are primarily managing related activities. \\nThe scope of this sustainability target relates to all materials for tire \\nproduction in the Tires group sector’s own operations. The retread-\\ning of tires as well as non-production materials are not taken into \\naccount in achieving this target. \\nThis intensity target is measured on the basis of the metric for the \\nweight share of renewable and recycled materials for tires produc-\\ntion as a percentage. The base year is 2024 and therefore the \\nbaseline value corresponds with the current result of the metric. \\nNo interim targets have been set. \\nThe overall commonly recognized concept of circularity includes in \\nparticular recycling and the use of renewable resources following \\nwith scientific studies. Continental’s target setting follows this gen-\\neral approach but does not consider a specific methodology for sci-\\nence-based target setting. \\nIn order to ensure the accuracy of material inflows accounted as re-\\ncycled or renewable, mass balance approaches prevailed as feasi-\\nble option in the past years in complex value chains. It allows regu-\\nlated, transparent and certified accounting of respective materials. \\nContinental follows those commonly recognized certification \\nschemes with the mass balance approach.  \\nThe methodology for calculating the metric is described in the cor-\\nresponding explanations for the metric. The target was defined \\nbased on internal qualitative analysis and calculations with regards \\nto the increase of the share of recycled and renewable materials. In \\ngeneral, materials are classified as renewable due to their general \\norigin, and as recycled if they are of secondary origin. Renewable \\nmaterials include bio-based resources that can return to their previ-\\nous stock levels through natural growth or renewal processes at a \\nrate in line with use cycles. The target level of at least 40 % was de-\\nfined based on internal feasibility studies as well as market extrapo-\\nlations. \\nThe target takes into account the interests of different stakeholders \\nsuch as customers using direct and indirect consultations.  \\nIn the reporting period, the target was reported for the very first \\ntime. \\nContinental’s target focuses on the resource inflows, especially with \\nregard to the increase in the share of renewable and secondary \\nmaterials as well as the reduction in the use of primary materials. \\nWe follow the cascading principle to use raw materials or products \\nmade of them for as long, as often and as efficiently as possible.  \\nThe target in particular supports the recycling level of the waste hi-\\nerarchy. \\nThe target has been set voluntarily to support the transition to-\\nwards closed resource and product cycles. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n163\\nKey Actions for Target Achievement \\nContinental has introduced concrete key actions to achieve the tar-\\nget of at least 40 % recycled and renewable materials share in tire \\nproduction by 2030. These actions mainly relate to the key levers \\nof material identification, strategies for securing sufficient supplies \\nand traceability, e.g. via the mass balance approach. Overall, actions \\nrelated to the target are also strongly connected with the overall \\nmanagement approach of circularity. In order to be able to react \\nflexibly to the changing market situation and changing needs, the \\nactions are further developed step by step. \\nThe identification of renewable and recycled materials is one deci-\\nsive factor to reach the target. Thus, the research and development \\ndepartment is continuously monitoring alternative materials to re-\\nplace non-renewable sources with renewable sources and primary \\nsources with secondary sources. Innovative approaches are pur-\\nsued as the usage of plant-based materials instead of fossil-based \\nfillers, oils and resins. The activities aimed at increasing the share of \\nrecycled or renewable materials are inherently embedded into the \\noperational processes of R&D. Thus, there is one overall process for \\nmaterial identification including material approval that is identical \\nfor recycled and renewable materials as well as non-recycled and \\nnon-renewable materials. \\nAs the availability of certain materials is crucial, there is a defined \\nset of renewable and recycled materials suitable to enable reaching \\nthe target. These materials are identified by internal experts from \\nR&D, sustainability and purchasing. This serves as a foundation to \\ndevelop corresponding material roadmaps and purchasing strate-\\ngies which are continuously monitored and updated. Materials that \\ncontribute towards increasing the share of recycled and renewable \\nproduction materials in the initial steps are, in particular, recovered \\ncarbon black and recycled polyester. \\nOn the basis of the identified materials that contribute towards \\nachieving the target of a minimum of 40 % recycled and renewable \\nmaterials for tire production, purchasing strategies including mate-\\nrial roadmaps are created with the involvement of experts from \\npurchasing, R&D and sustainability. The creation and review of \\nthese roadmaps defines the overall framework of measures for the \\nlong-term procurement of the respective materials with implemen-\\ntation scenarios. In addition, concrete short-term actions are devel-\\noped on this basis as flexible elements such as material-specific \\nprocurement activities in order to react to changing market situa-\\ntions. These plans are coordinated and agreed with the board of \\nthe Tires group sector, and regularly reviewed and adapted as \\nneeded. While the integration of selected materials requires only \\nlimited adaptation in production processes, their availability in \\nterms of large volumes at economically compatible cost is a deci-\\nsive factor. In any case, Continental guarantees the same uniform  \\nlevel of safety and performance of all our tires. Whenever possible, \\nContinental strives to secure volumes of relevant materials in the \\nlong term. \\nFor the Tires group sector, natural rubber is a key raw material that \\nalso contributes towards the share of renewable and recycled pro-\\nduction materials. Therefore, with our partnerships along the value \\nchain and the corresponding purchasing strategies, Continental will \\ncontinue to source natural rubber and secure sufficient quantities \\nfor the coming years. As concrete examples of actions that contrib-\\nute towards achieving the target, Continental invests in processes \\nfor obtaining high-quality recycled materials for example through \\nthe strategic partnership with Pyrum to implement a circular ap-\\nproach to recycling of old tires. Using a special pyrolysis process, \\ncarbon black, oil and gas are recovered as secondary resources \\nand used for the production of new tires, among other purposes. \\nSimilarly, with its ContiRe.Tex solution, Continental has invented to-\\ngether with the partner Otiz a process for high-performance yarn \\nthat allows conventional polyester to be replaced with polyester \\nmade from recycled PET-bottles. First products with recycled PET \\nbottles are already introduced and a global rollout of this material \\nin all Continental tire plants is foreseen within the year 2025. \\nThe creation of transparency and reliable information on recycled \\nand renewable materials through the various steps in our complex \\nvalue chains is a key action for Continental. Over the last few years, \\nmass balance approaches prevailed as standard especially in chem-\\nical industry, allowing the regulated and transparent accounting of \\nthe quantities and the respective characteristics of recycled and re-\\nnewable materials. We see mass balance approaches as a neces-\\nsary tool for the transition away from fossil resources in our mate-\\nrial value chains. It reduces complexity, speeds up the adoption of \\nmaterials and ensures continuous supply. If materials certified as re-\\ncycled or renewable are combined with other non-certified materi-\\nals in production processes, accounting following the mass balance \\napproach ensures accurate recording and allocation of the respec-\\ntive certified shares according to the actual material inflows. In this \\nway, the quantities accounted as recycled and renewable are corre-\\nspondingly certified and made transparent and traceable along the \\nentire value chain. We therefore require suppliers to actively partici-\\npate in these frameworks where relevant, for example ISCC PLUS. \\nThe actions with regards to increasing the recycled and renewable \\nshare in tire production materials are embedded into operational \\nactivities especially in the areas of research and development and \\npurchasing. The actions include short- and medium-term measures. \\nThe progress of the related actions (in the reporting year) is espe-\\ncially measured by the progress of the target KPI \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n164\\nCapital expenditures and operating expenditures for key actions to achieve the target related to resource use and circular \\neconomy \\nOpEx for key actions  \\n2024 \\nOpEx for key actions to achieve targets related to resource use \\nand circular economy, in € millions \\n1,009 \\n \\n \\nDefinitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: \\n- Includes operating expenditure (OpEx) for key actions to implement the targets \\nrelating to resource use and circular economy.

The calculated \\ninventory as of January 1st is considered. \\nContinental has a diverse product portfolio serving the automotive \\nand other industries. Due to the differences in the individual prod-\\nucts, target markets, use cases and user behavior, it is almost im-\\npossible to predict the expected durability across the board. The \\nactual durability of a specific product may deviate from the follow-\\ning estimates in individual cases. \\nFor all tires, service conditions vary widely depending on vehicle \\nand use as well as other factors such as inflation pressure, load, \\nspeed, road conditions, frequency of rotation, and storage condi-\\ntions. Nonetheless regarding the estimated durability of tires, it is \\nessential to replace passenger car tires and commercial vehicle \\ntires when the tread depth falls below 1.6 mm, as this is the mini-\\nmum legal limit across the European Union. In industry-wide prod-\\nuct tests by external associations, passenger car tires often achieve \\nan overall mileage of 20,000 km to 70,000 km until the legal mini-\\nmum tread depth of 1.6 mm is reached. There, Continental tires \\nrank among the best. Furthermore, in the tire industry, it is gener-\\nally recommended to check and replace a tire after 10 years if \\nneeded.  \\nFor the automotive industry, the key products of the Automotive \\ngroup sector are electronic brake systems, electronic control units, \\ntelematics, access systems, as well as surround radars and display \\nsolutions. For the ContiTech group sector, the product portfolio  \\n', \" \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n167\\ncomprises a wide selection of products ranging from components \\nfor vehicle interiors to steering systems and air spring systems spe-\\ncifically for commercial vehicles. Generally, the service life of our \\nproducts for the automotive industry must be equal to the entire \\nservice life of the vehicle and thus correspond to the operational \\nservice life of the vehicle in which they are installed. In accordance \\nwith the assumptions applied to Scope 3 emissions for the use of \\nproducts sold, the average service life of a passenger car is esti-\\nmated at 200,000 km and that of a commercial vehicle at \\n1,000,000 km. Although expected service life can vary widely de-\\npending on vehicle type and application conditions, our products \\nfor the automotive industry meet the durability expectations of au-\\ntomotive manufacturers, which are generally a minimum service \\nlife of 150,000 km and/or 10 years. \\nThe industry business of the ContiTech group sector has a highly \\ndiverse portfolio with different applications and specifications in nu-\\nmerous branches such as drive belts, storage solution, hoses and \\nniche products like printing blankets. The expected durability can \\nvary significantly depending on sourrounding conditions and the \\nfinal use-case of the product, that is not always known to Continental. \\nThese main factors influencing the product's longevity are setting a \\nproduct lifespan ranging from a few years up to several decades. \\nTo date, there is no established external assessment system for the \\nrepairability of Continental’s products. Nevertheless, we are con-\\nstantly working on expanding circular product design, as described \\nin the management approach on circularity, and offer correspond-\\ning services and products, among others. In principle, our products \\ncan be repaired in the event of damage, but the actual possibility \\ndepends on many factors, including the actual condition of the \\nproduct and the degree of damage. In particular, damage such as \\npunctures in the tire can be sealed again using specific procedures \\nso that the tire can continue to be used. In the case of products for \\nthe automotive industry, repairs can often be carried out in motor \\nvehicle workshops. Continental operates its own international net-\\nwork of workshops in this area. Products from the ContiTech group \\nsector can also be repaired under certain conditions in the event of \\ndamage. We also offer corresponding services such as the repair-\\ning of our conveyor belts and hose solutions. \\nFor safety-relevant components (e.g. tires), restrictions on repaira-\\nbility may also apply for safety reasons. The corresponding man-\\nagement approaches Technical and product compliance and Safe \\nmobility can be found in the Consumers and end-users (ESRS S4) \\nsection. \\n \\n \\n\", ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Environmental Information \\n168\\nWaste and recyclable content \\n \\nWaste diverted from disposal, in million t \\n2024 \\n(1) Non-hazardous waste for reuse \\n0.000 \\n(2) Non-hazardous waste for recycling \\n0.309 \\n(3) Non-hazardous waste for other recovery operations \\n0.069 \\n(4) Non-hazardous waste diverted from disposal \\n0.378 \\n(5) Hazardous waste for reuse \\n0.000 \\n(6) Hazardous waste for recycling \\n0.017 \\n(7) Hazardous waste for other recovery operations \\n0.009 \\n(8) Hazardous waste diverted from disposal \\n0.025 \\n(9) Total waste diverted from disposal \\n0.403 \\n \\n \\nDefinitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: \\nOverarching information for positions (1) – (9): \\n- The data is collected by the individual locations.

The descrip-\\ntions of the negative impacts and risks are presented from a gross \\nperspective which, on the basis of the applied methodology, does \\nnot take into account mitigation through the management ap-\\nproaches of Continental as described in the respective IRO cluster. \\nThis perspective is used to determine where appropriate manage-\\nment approaches are relevant and corresponding reporting is re-\\nquired. As positive impacts as well as opportunities are strength-\\nened by Continental’s management approaches, the descriptions \\nare presented taking a net perspective which, for methodical rea-\\nsons, considers the results of the management approaches. \\nThe descriptions of the IROs are to be regarded as self-contained, \\nwhich may result in repetitions. \\nLabor standards \\n› In 2024, Continental recorded individual incidents related to \\nworking time in its own workforce. Beyond the confirmed inci-\\ndents, Continental operates in countries, certain markets and \\nbusiness activities in which significant negative impacts related to \\nworking time can occur if they are not adequately prevented or \\nmitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 41) \\n› Continental operates in countries, certain markets and business \\nactivities in which Continental’s working time arrangements pre-\\nsumably have a significant positive impact on its own workforce. \\nAssuming that this can put pressure on other market participants \\nto also introduce higher standards, this could also have a positive \\nimpact on the market environment. (see ESRS 2, IRO table,  \\nimpact 42) \\n› Continental has recorded individual incidents of discrimination \\nwithin own workforce for 2024. Beyond the confirmed incidents, \\nContinental operates in certain markets and business activities \\nwhere significant negative impacts related to discrimination \\nwithin own workforce due to gender, age, race, skin color, health \\nstatus, disability, social or ethnic origin, nationality, sexual orienta-\\ntion, political opinion, religion or beliefs, or any other characteris-\\ntics protected by applicable laws and regulations can occur if \\nthey are not adequately prevented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO \\ntable, impact 49) \\n› Continental operates in certain markets and business activities in \\nwhich significant negative impacts related to forced labor (includ-\\ning debt bondage) can occur if they are not adequately pre-\\nvented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 50) \\n› Continental operates in certain markets and business activities \\nwhere significant negative impacts related to child labor and \\nyoung workers can occur if they are not adequately prevented or \\nmitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 51) \\n› Continental operates in certain markets and industries where  \\npotential incidents related to labor laws, other regulations or con-\\ntractual agreements with customers regarding working condi-\\ntions and labor standards could occur within the own operations. \\nIf, in the worst-case scenario, due diligence processes were to fail \\nand serious violations were to occur, Continental can face sanc-\\ntions with substantial penalties and fines or even business on \\nhold for the respective business operation, especially in the  \\nmedium term. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 53) \\n› Continental operates in certain markets and industries where  \\npotential incidents can occur in relation to harassment or discrim-\\nination in the workplace in own operations. If, in the worst-case \\nscenario, due diligence processes were to fail and serious viola-\\ntions were to occur, Continental could face sanctions with sub-\\nstantial penalties and fines or even business on hold for the re-\\nspective business operation, especially in the medium term. (see \\nESRS 2, IRO table, risk 55) \\n› Continental operates in certain markets and industries where  \\npotential incidents can occur in relation to forced labor (including \\ndebt bondage), child labor and other human rights. If, in the \\nworst-case scenario, due diligence processes were to fail and seri-\\nous violations were to occur, Continental can face sanctions with \\nsubstantial penalties and fines or even business on hold for the \\nrespective business operation, especially in the medium term. \\n(see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 56) \\n› Continental operates in certain markets and industries where  \\npotential incidents can occur in relation to forced labor (including \\ndebt bondage), child labor and other human rights. If, in the \\nworst-case scenario, due diligence processes were to fail and seri-\\nous violations were to occur, Continental could face potential boy-\\ncotts, which in turn, if managed reasonably, could lead to critical \\nsales losses in the respective business activities, especially in the \\nmedium term. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 57) \\nSustainability Report – \\nSocial Information \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n171\\nAdequate wages \\n› Continental has recorded individual incidents within own work-\\nforce related to inadequate wages and unfair payment in 2024. \\nBeyond the confirmed incidents, Continental operates in coun-\\ntries, certain markets and business activities where significant \\nnegative impacts related to inadequate pay or unfair pay can oc-\\ncur if they are not adequately prevented or mitigated. (see  \\nESRS 2, IRO table, impact 39) \\n› Continental operates in countries, certain markets and business \\nactivities in which it can be assumed that Continental has some \\npositive impact on the market environment by paying adequate \\nwages if it is assumed that this could put pressure on other mar-\\nket participants to also pay adequate wages. This positive impact \\nis seen as relevant to the information needs of users of sustaina-\\nbility reporting. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 40) \\nWork-life balance \\n› Continental operates in industries in which significant challenges \\nto the work-life balance of its own employees (e.g. in connection \\nwith shift models) can arise if they are not adequately prevented \\nor mitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 43) \\nTraining and skill development \\n› Continental provides training and measures for skill development \\nin countries, certain markets and business activities where it is as-\\nsumed that the implemented training and measures for skill de-\\nvelopment for Continental’s own workforce have a significant pos-\\nitive impact on its own workforce as well as on the market envi-\\nronment, as this could put pressure on other market participants \\nto also offer training and measures for skill development on this \\nscale. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 48) \\n› Continental operates in markets with strong competition, includ-\\ning for skilled workers. If the company does not succeed in recruit-\\ning, retaining and training qualified employees or managing em-\\nployee turnover appropriately, this can lead to significant interrup-\\ntions and productivity losses in the respective business activities, \\nespecially in the medium term. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 54) \\nSecure employment and social dialogue \\n› Continental operates in countries, certain markets, industries and \\nbusiness activities that are undergoing a considerable transition, \\nwhich is already having a moderate negative impact on job secu-\\nrity. The transition could also have substantial negative impacts \\non employees in connection with job security (e.g. due to transfor-\\nmation projects, site closures or restructuring), if they are not ade-\\nquately prevented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 45) \\n› Continental creates jobs and provides secure employment and \\nqualifications in countries, markets and certain business activities \\nwhere it is assumed that this has significant positive impacts for \\nthe employees and the local markets. (see ESRS 2, IRO table,  \\nimpact 46) \\n› Continental maintains social dialogue through various channels \\nand takes into account in particular the representation of its own \\nworkforce as well as employee participation, e.g. in the form of \\nemployee surveys, which is expected to have a significant posi-\\ntive impact, particularly on its own employees and their repre-\\nsentatives. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 47) \\nEmployee privacy \\n› Continental processes vast amounts of employee data in own op-\\nerations. In particular, given the size of Continental’s workforce \\nand the company’s global presence, significant potential viola-\\ntions of employees’ data protection rights can occur if they are \\nnot adequately prevented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2, IRO table,  \\nimpact 52) \\nOccupational safety and health \\n› Continental operates in industries and types of operations in \\nwhich there are numerous potential sources of health hazards for \\nemployees, particularly with regard to the use of machinery, phys-\\nically demanding workplaces, accidents and the handling of haz-\\nardous substances, ergonomics and psychological risks. In 2024, \\nContinental recorded accidents and health-related incidents. Be-\\nyond the recorded accidents and confirmed incidents, significant \\nnegative impacts on the health of own workforce could occur if \\nthese are not adequately prevented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2, \\nIRO table, impact 44) \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n172\\nFurther Information on the IRO Assessment in Relation to Own Workforce \\nIn the IRO assessment, Continental identified both actual and po-\\ntential positive and negative impacts on its own workforce in the \\ntopic areas of labor standards, adequate wages, work-life balance, \\ntraining and skill development, secure employment and social dia-\\nlogue, employee privacy, and occupational safety and health as de-\\nscribed at the beginning of this section. These impacts are associ-\\nated with Continental’s strategy and business model and relate in \\nparticular to countries, certain markets, industries, and business ac-\\ntivities that are critically or significantly exposed to such impacts. \\nThe identified actual and potential impacts on own workforce are \\nimportant for adapting the strategy and business model. The devel-\\nopment of measures and strategic decisions based on the identi-\\nfied impacts are described as part of the management approaches. \\nAs indicated by the respective descriptions, all identified risks re-\\nsult directly from identified actual and potential impacts as well as \\nfrom the dependence on own workforce as an important intangi-\\nble resource. They are also based on the breadth and diversity of \\ncountries, markets, industries and business activities in which \\nContinental operates. \\nTherefore, the risks are inherently linked to Continental’s strategy \\nand business model. \\nThe consolidation at group level of the assessment of the impacts, \\nrisks and opportunities for own workforce includes Continental’s \\nentire workforce. Links to business activities, the product portfolio \\nand the value chain are taken into account where relevant. \\nIn general, our activities have an actual or potential positive or neg-\\native impact on the entire workforce of Continental – both own em-\\nployees and non-employees. The group of non-employees also in-\\ncludes temporary workers and subcontractors. \\nThe IRO assessment led to a deeper understanding of which parts \\nof the workforce are at greater risk of harm based on particular ac-\\ntivities, contexts or characteristics. This understanding results in \\nparticular from the consideration of industry specifics, regional \\ncharacteristics and potential discriminatory features as part of the \\nIRO assessment, as described in the respective IROs. \\nContinental operates in many industries, countries and markets \\nworldwide and is therefore also represented in regions where there \\nis considerable potential for negative impacts with regard to child \\nlabor, in particular India, Brazil and South Africa.  \\nThe same also applies to forced labor (including so called debt \\nbondage), in particular in China, Mexico and India. \\nThe assessment of the material negative impacts regarding own \\nworkforce were integrated in the general impact, risk and oppor-\\ntunity assessment following the defined methodology (see the \\nOverview of material impacts, risks and opportunities subsection in \\nthe General disclosures (ESRS 2) section).  \\nThe methodology takes into consideration two perspectives: All \\nnegative impacts are to be considered widespread or systemic as \\nthey relate to countries, certain markets, industries and business \\nactivities where Continental operates. In addition, the methodol-\\nogy takes into account event-based actual negative impacts \\nwherever the impact description contains a reference to concrete \\nactual incidents. \\nThe reported positive impacts on the workforce are related to the \\nactivities described under the management approach for the re-\\nspective IRO cluster. \\nThe material impacts on own workforce are not directly related to \\nchanges resulting from sustainability, e.g. the transition towards \\nzero-tailpipe-emission vehicles. \\nMaterial risks arising from the impacts and dependencies on own \\nworkforce relate to Continental’s entire workforce. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n173\\nManagement Approaches to Own Workforce \\nThis section describes the management approaches that Continen-\\ntal pursues in order to address the material impacts on own work-\\nforce and the associated material risks. These are subdivided into \\nthe following areas: labor standards, adequate wages, work-life bal-\\nance, training and skill development, secure employment and social \\ndialogue, employee privacy, and occupational safety and health. \\n \\nLabor standards \\nContinental has defined an approach for the management of labor \\nstandards for its own workforce that is intended to prevent and re-\\nduce actual and potential negative impacts and risks as well as \\nstrengthen positive impacts with regard to working time, discrimi-\\nnation, forced labor and child labor as well as other human rights \\nand working conditions. This is part of the “Responsible Value \\nChain Due Diligence System” (RVCDDS).  \\nContinental is thus pursuing the ambition of creating good work-\\ning conditions and a 100 % responsible value chain by 2050 at \\nthe latest. As part of the RVCDDS, Continental has adopted so-\\ncalled Responsible Value Chain Commitments (RVC commit-\\nments), which include the following for the area of labor stand-\\nards: no child labor, fair payment, equal treatment, no forced la-\\nbor or modern slavery, freedom of association and working con-\\nditions, including working time. \\nWith the specific RVC commitment for equal treatment, Continental \\nstrives for a working environment that is free from discrimination, \\nincluding harassment, in any form. This is an integral part of the \\nmanagement system and is supported by dedicated diversity man-\\nagement aimed at promoting equal opportunities and advancing \\ndiversity and inclusion. \\nThe commitment explicitly addresses creating a working environ-\\nment free from any form of discrimination based on gender, age, \\nrace, skin color, health status, disability, social or ethnic origin, na-\\ntionality, sexual orientation, political opinion, religion or beliefs or any \\nother characteristics protected by applicable laws and regulations. \\nThe topic of inclusion and actions for people from vulnerable \\ngroups of employees are also covered by this commitment. \\nThe management approach also covers the prevention of potential \\ntrafficking in human beings, forced labor or compulsory labor and \\nchild labor. Continental firmly rejects any form of child labor and \\ndoes not employ people under the age of 15 or under the age at \\nwhich compulsory schooling ends or under the applicable coun-\\ntry’s minimum age for employment, whichever is greatest. Young \\nemployees under the age of 18 need to be treated with special dili-\\ngence. Any form of forced labor, modern slavery, debt bondage,  \\ntrafficking, or any other form of labor not conducted voluntarily is \\nalso firmly rejected. Workers must be provided with documented \\nemployment terms or an offer of employment in a language they \\nare able to understand. Migrant workers need to be treated with \\nspecial diligence. \\nThe management approach directly covers Continental’s own em-\\nployees, while the RVC commitments also include non-employees. \\nOverall accountability for the RVCDDS, including the RVC commit-\\nments for labor standards, lies with the Executive Board. The latter \\nhas appointed a human rights officer who manages the system. \\nThe specific human relations (HR) frameworks for labor standards \\nare defined and implemented by the respective HR departments \\nalong the company structure. Responsibility for the implementation \\nof the labor standards lies with the management of the respective \\nlegal entities. \\nThe system is comprised of many processes that include strategy \\ndevelopment and implementation, the management of regulations, \\nimpact and risk management, incident management (including \\nwhistleblowing) and training. In order to monitor the effectiveness \\nof the system, a multi-stage process has been set up based on the \\n“three lines” model. The first line is formed by the local operational \\nHR departments. They implement the operational tasks at business \\nlevel and at the location in accordance with the RVCDDS and the \\nassociated HR rules. The second line, represented by non-opera-\\ntional HR departments and roles, oversees the system, roles and re-\\nsponsibilities as well as their effectiveness. The third line is Conti-\\nnental’s internal audit function, which performs an independent \\nevaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the RVCDDS. \\nSpecific preventive and remedial measures are defined for the re-\\nspective RVC commitments for the area of labor standards, which \\nare implemented by the legal entities, such as self-assessments, the \\nimplementation of appropriate rules and instructions, the careful \\nanalysis of the working environment with regard to aspects that \\ncould cause harm, the implementation of improvement measures \\nand control mechanisms, as well as raising awareness, especially \\namong managers.  \\nWith regard to working time, Continental implemented further dedi-\\ncated processes with regard to flexible working models as stated in \\ndetail in the management approach to work-life balance. \\nAs part of an annual review process with the Executive Board, the \\nentire RVCDDS, including the specific processes for labor standards \\nin own operations, is evaluated in terms of effectiveness, adequacy \\nand potential for improvement. The RVCDDS is additionally inte-\\ngrated into Continental’s overarching internal control system, the \\nrisk management system and compliance management system. \\n', \" \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n174\\nIn line with the RVC commitments, the RVCDDS also defines the \\nframework for taking remedial action in own operations. Any identi-\\nfied violations must be addressed promptly and remedial actions \\nmust be implemented without unnecessary delay. These actions \\nare designed not only to end the violation but also to ensure that \\nsimilar issues are prevented in the future. \\nSpecific processes to prevent discrimination and to act accord-\\ningly if incidents are identified are part of the RVCDDS and the \\ngeneral processes of the integrity system described in the Busi-\\nness conduct and corporate governance (ESRS G1) section. The \\nprevention of discrimination is implemented through general HR \\nprocesses in the areas of improving frame conditions and specific \\ninitiatives for women, which comprise dedicated awareness-raising \\nevents, education offers as well as transparent HR processes in re-\\nlation to recruitment and talent management. With regard to gen-\\nder diversity, Continental has defined a target and key actions to \\nachieve the target, as described in the subsections on Targets re-\\nlated to own workforce and Key actions for target achievement in \\nthis section. \\nThe management approach is regulated by a dedicated responsi-\\nble value chain rule. It serves as the basis for further rules defining \\nspecifics for labor standards. They are complemented by special \\nprocesses that are focused on diversity and belonging. Additionally, \\nthe respect for human rights and fair working conditions are em-\\nbedded in Continental's Code of Conduct, which forms the basis for \\ncollaboration among all our employees.  \\nContinental’s management approach to respect for human rights \\nand labor standards is in line with both international frameworks as \\nwell as local regulations. These include the internationally recog-\\nnized conventions on human rights, such as the United Nations \\nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. \\nContinental’s management approach to respect for human rights \\nand labor standards is also in line with the key points of the Interna-\\ntional Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization \\n(ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work \\nand the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These com-\\nmitments serve as a global minimum standard for all Continental \\nlocations and form the basis for compliance with local laws and \\nregulations. Additionally, Continental is a signatory of initiatives like \\nthe German Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter). The company \\nalso endorses the Women’s Empowerment Principles established \\nby the UN Global Compact and UN Women, demonstrating its dedi-\\ncation to promoting diversity and inclusion across its operations. \\nMonitoring of the adherence to these standards is anchored in the \\nRVCDDS review process, including a revision of its rules and pro-\\ncesses, if required. \\nTo incorporate stakeholder interests into the management system, \\nContinental has established various formats. These include specific \\nworkshops and conferences, which are defined as measures by the \\nlabor standards rules. Another format is the regular Employee Sur-\\nvey OUR BASICS Live in which Continental’s employees are asked \\nabout different topics related to Continental’s values. The integra-\\ntion of these interests into the system is carried out as part of the \\nannual review process. \\nTo ensure a comprehensive understanding and engagement related \\nto labor standards within the organization, Continental communi-\\ncates the management approach through diverse channels. This in-\\ncludes our website and internal communication platforms which \\nhost trainings as well as the frameworks. In addition, posters and on-\\nsite training courses make relevant information available to employ-\\nees who do not have access to the IT infrastructure. Furthermore, \\nthrough integration into the onboarding process, new employees \\nare also familiarized with these standards right from the start.  \\nFurthermore, stakeholders involved in implementing the manage-\\nment approach have clearly defined roles within the RVCDDS and \\nare trained on the associated responsibilities to enable effective col-\\nlaboration and execution of the management approach. \\n \\nAdequate wages \\nWith its management approach to adequate wages, Continental \\naims to provide fair pay for all employees, as anchored in the RVC \\ncommitments. In those, Continental has formulated the commit-\\nment that compensation paid to employees shall comply with all \\napplicable wage laws and regulations, including those relating to \\nminimum wages, living wages, overtime hours, and legally man-\\ndated benefits. In compliance with local laws and regulations, em-\\nployees shall be compensated for overtime in a reasonable way. \\nDeductions from wages as a disciplinary measure shall not be per-\\nmitted. For each pay period, employees shall be provided with a \\ntimely and understandable wage statement that includes sufficient \\ninformation to verify accurate compensation for work performed.  \\nThe management approach covers Continental’s own employees, \\nwhile the RVC commitment also includes non-employees. \\nOverall accountability for the management approach lies with the \\nExecutive Board. The specific rules are defined and implemented \\nby the respective HR departments along the company structure. \\nResponsibility for the implementation of adequate wages lies with \\nthe management of the respective legal entities. \\nThe processes of the RVCDDS, as described in the management \\napproach for labor standards, also apply explicitly to the topic of \\nadequate wages as one of our RVC commitments. The system is  \\n\", ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n175\\ncomprised of many processes that include strategy development \\nand implementation, the management of regulations, impact and \\nrisk management, incident management (including whistleblowing) \\nand training, as well as the “three lines” model for system control. \\nContinental’s general remuneration processes include the involve-\\nment of employee representatives and the consideration of bench-\\nmarks. These measures create a basis for preventing inadequate \\nwages. In addition, further specific preventive and remedial \\nmeasures for the legal entities are defined in respective rules. This \\nincludes, for example, regularly checking whether payments com-\\nply with national and local legislation, clearly communicating remu-\\nneration principles to employees, ensuring timely and regular pay-\\nments and reviewing and updating appropriate benchmarks. \\nMonitoring is carried out through the annual review process of the \\nRVCDDS, in which the Executive Board is informed of the current \\nstatus and decides on the effectiveness, adequacy and potential for \\nimprovement. The effectiveness of the management approach can \\nalso be measured by the metric for adequate wages. \\nThe RVCDDS is formalized by a dedicated rule. Other rules define \\nthe specific aspects for fair payment and adequate wages. \\nWith its management approach, Continental follows the internationally \\nrecognized standards and frameworks on human rights and labor \\nstandards, as described in more detail in the management approach \\nto labor standards, as well as the applicable local laws on wages. \\nThe most important stakeholder perspective to be considered in \\nthe management approach to adequate wages is the perspective \\nof employees. To obtain this, the regular Employee Survey OUR BA-\\nSICS Live includes dedicated questions on the topic of remunera-\\ntion and recognition, with a special focus on fair payment. Remu-\\nneration models are discussed with the involvement of the respec-\\ntive works councils or employee representatives to ensure the con-\\nsideration of employees’ interests. Specific cases of inadequate \\nwages can also be reported through the integrity system. \\nThe consideration of this information is integrated into the over-\\narching annual RVCDDS review process. \\nTo inform all stakeholders affected and those involved in the imple-\\nmentation about the management approach, rules, trainings and \\nfurther communication material are communicated via Conti-\\nnental’s internal communication channels.  \\nWork-life balance \\nContinental strives to create good working conditions to support \\nthe work-life balance and to promote the flexibility and well-being \\nof all employees, regardless of their working time model. In this \\ncontext, the specific requirements of the various markets in which \\nContinental operates and the different types of activities, are taken \\ninto account. One focus is on the challenges of work-life balance, \\nparticularly for employees working in shift models.  \\nThe management approach covers Continental’s own employees, \\nwhereby the focuses vary depending on the respective work models.  \\nGovernance of the respective measures and frameworks lies with \\nthe non-operational HR functions, while the implementation is del-\\negated to the operational local HR departments and managers. \\nOverall accountability for the framework lies with the Executive \\nBoard. \\nKey processes within the management approach cover the areas \\nof flexibility and further employee benefits. With regard to flexible \\nworking conditions, Continental has implemented a wide range of \\nmeasures to enable its employees to achieve a healthy work-life \\nbalance. These include, e. g. hybrid work, flexible arrangements and \\nworking time models, sabbaticals, family-related leave including pa-\\nrental leave, and partial retirement. Beyond this, Continental offers \\nits employees further benefits, such as childcare opportunities and \\nsport offers. Continental is actively expanding the opportunities of \\nflexible work and is also involving its shopfloor employees in the \\nprocess. For shift working models, Continental has implemented \\ndedicated processes in accordance with local laws, to enable \\ngreater flexibility. The implementation of these measures varies by \\nlocation and is tailored to local needs and regulations. \\nThe effectiveness of the management approach is monitored \\nthrough the results of the OUR BASICS Live employee survey \\nwhich is conducted on a regular basis. In the survey, employees \\nprovide feedback on how flexible working models at Continental \\nsupport them in balancing work and private life. They also give \\ntheir assessment of how they are able to cope with the stress level \\nin their workplace. This feedback helps to assess and improve \\nContinental’s approaches. \\nThe processes for improving the work-life balance of Continental’s \\nemployees are defined by dedicated internal frameworks and sub-\\nsequent country-specific rules in adherence with local laws. Addi-\\ntionally, a comprehensive set of guidelines, tools, methods, and up-\\nskilling initiatives has been created to promote flexible work models \\nacross the organization. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n176\\nThe management approach is not based on specific external stand-\\nards, but on research findings and best practices with regard to a \\nhealthy work-life balance.  \\nTo consider employees’ interests, Continental is pursuing a collabo-\\nrative approach by working closely with works councils and ac-\\ntively involving managers, employees and relevant functions such \\nas the law department. The OUR BASICS Live survey offers an addi-\\ntional channel for gaining insights into satisfaction with the work-\\nlife balance. \\nContinental communicates its management approach and flexibil-\\nity measures via the internal communication channels, making \\nthem accessible to employees at any time. This also includes local \\ncommunication channels to reach employees at production sites. \\nBeyond this, Continental actively uses its communication channels \\nto share information and guidance with its employees on how to \\nimprove their work-life balance. \\n \\nTraining and skill development \\nContinental promotes continuous learning for employees to sup-\\nport them in meeting evolving skills requirements and thereby miti-\\ngate risks associated with skill gaps and business interruptions. \\nThe management approach covers all of Continental’s own em-\\nployees. \\nAccountability for the governance of training and skill development \\nas well as the related tools and learning landscape lies with the dif-\\nferent HR functions along Continental’s company structure. The \\nframework for specific trainings is defined by the respective func-\\ntions (e.g. safety and health or compliance). Responsibility for the \\nimplementation of the skill development measures lies with the \\nmanagement of the respective legal entities. \\nContinental’s learning landscape provides the frame for meeting \\nthe company’s training and skill development requirements. This \\nframe is filled with training content developed by the various func-\\ntions and entities to meet their specific needs and regulatory re-\\nquirements for employee training. Besides these function- or busi-\\nness-specific trainings, there are overarching training programs that \\nare managed by the HR departments and implemented locally, e.g. \\noffers for leadership development. To host these offers Continental \\nhas set up a dedicated learning platform. The platform categorizes \\nthe available trainings and programs by topic and makes them ac-\\ncessible to employees. It also manages the allocation of training \\nmeasures to employees. Monitoring of individual training programs \\ncan also be set up through this platform. In addition, the alignment \\non adequate training and development measures is an integral part \\nof the employee dialogue between supervisors and employees in \\norder to support individual skill development through a standard-\\nized process. \\nIn Germany, the Continental Institute for Technology and Transfor-\\nmation (CITT) is an additional important pillar that proactively of-\\nfers employees the opportunity to upskill themselves in future-ori-\\nented fields in order to prepare them for the evolving job market \\nand new requirements. The CITT offers programs and qualification \\nopportunities in the fields of robotics, virtual and augmented reality, \\n3D printing, agile methods and digital skills, and includes offers for \\nsemi-skilled workers, skilled workers and academics. In addition to \\nGerman locations, the offers are also available at some other Euro-\\npean locations. \\nThe management approach regarding training and skill develop-\\nment is defined in several specific HR rules. \\nFor the training architecture for leaders, the ISO Norm 29993 \\nserved as a reference. \\nThe most important stakeholders with regard to training and skill \\ndevelopment are Continental’s own employees who benefit from \\nthe training and skill development offers. Their interests are taken \\ninto account in the management approach through feedback op-\\ntions on existing training materials. In addition, there are topic-spe-\\ncific learning communities that are established via Continental’s in-\\nternal communication channels. Individual interests and needs are \\ntaken into account through regular employee dialogue between \\nemployees and supervisors. \\nEmployees are informed about this management approach via \\ndedicated platforms within the internal communication channels. \\nThis includes the comprehensive learning platform as well as spe-\\ncific topic-related learning communities, which are aimed at em-\\nployees in specific areas and inform them about existing training \\nopportunities. \\n \\nSecure employment and social dialogue \\nSecure employment and social dialogue are of the utmost interest \\nfor the company and for the employees. Therefore, with its corre-\\nsponding management approach, Continental strives to shape the \\ntransition of our industries in close dialogue with our employees, \\nwhile balancing economic and social needs. \\nThe management approach covers all of Continental’s own em-\\nployees. \\nIn principle, employment matters and social dialogue are regulated \\nby labor law. Therefore, the formal accountability for the manage-\\nment approach is partially determined by local legislation. This in-\\ncludes the responsibilities of the Supervisory Board, the Executive \\nBoard, the management of Continental’s legal entities as well as the \\nco-determination bodies, e.g. works councils. Operational imple-\\nmentation is primarily managed by Continental’s HR departments \\nalong the company structure. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n177\\nSocial dialogue and employee engagement are managed through \\nvarious processes. Formalized processes especially include the rep-\\nresentation of employees by works councils or similar structures as \\nwell as the regular employee survey OUR BASICS Live. In addition, \\nContinental has established a variety of formats for social dialogue \\nand employee engagement, including townhall meetings, networks, \\nopen calls and online platforms. This foundation for social dialogue \\nis also the basis for managing employment matters in the transition \\nof our industries. \\nWith regard to secure employment, Continental has established a \\nset of processes, projects and measures. They mitigate the nega-\\ntive impacts of the transformation on employees and simultane-\\nously create positive effects in terms of the creation of jobs and up-\\nskilling. \\n› In contract design, the focus is on providing employees with long-\\nterm offers. Flexible working time, mobile work options, and other \\nbenefits regarding employee working conditions, as described in \\nthe management approaches to work-life balance and adequate \\nwages, are intended to proactively reduce employee turnover. \\n› With regard to the impacts of the transformation, Continental has \\ncreated a range of opportunities to prepare employees for the job \\nmarket of the future. These are set out in the management ap-\\nproach to training and skill development. \\n› Job changes are also supported through a global internal job \\nmarket. \\n› Especially in Germany, which is significantly affected by transfor-\\nmation processes - for example, due to increasing digitalization \\nand technological change – Continental has established pro-\\ncesses to support employees in external job transitions to other \\nemployers that offer better employment opportunities at the re-\\nspective location (“von Arbeit in Arbeit”). These processes also in-\\nclude discussions with potential external employers.  \\nThe effectiveness of the management approach is monitored via \\ndedicated feedback channels, HR processes and the reported metrics \\n“Percentage of employees covered by employee representation”, \\n“Employee turnover” and the OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engage-\\nment index. \\nThe processes are regulated through Continental’s internal HR rules \\nand by-laws as well as agreements with works councils. \\nKey aspects regarding secure employment and social dialogue are \\nregulated in particular by local laws, regulations and regulatory pro-\\nvisions. \\nBy definition, social dialogue is an interest-based exchange with \\nemployees and their representatives. In order to gain further in-\\nsights and consider the interests of its own workforce in the man-\\nagement approach, Continental uses its internal communication \\nchannels and has integrated feedback processes into various en-\\ngagement formats and training courses. An additional formalized \\nprocess is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey, which gathers \\nthe employee’s opinions and views on various topics related to \\nContinental’s values. These are recorded, consolidated and ana-\\nlyzed in an established process. Furthermore, co-determination \\npractices such as employee representation on the Supervisory \\nBoard and the involvement of the Group Works Council in relevant \\ndecision-making processes directly incorporate the interests of em-\\nployees and enable the alignment of management strategies with \\ntheir needs. \\nMany communication and dialogue formats (e.g. townhall meet-\\nings) already inherently constitute social dialogue. In addition, \\nContinental’s management approach to secure employment and \\nsocial dialogue is also communicated to employees via established \\ninternal communication channels, usually in the broader context of \\nthe associated transformations. This includes newsletters and dedi-\\ncated channels managed by local works councils to inform the \\nworkforce. For information on training offers, a dedicated platform \\nis available, as described in detail in the management approach to \\ntraining and skill development. This is complemented by local com-\\nmunication on site to reach employees who do not have access to \\nthe IT infrastructure. \\n \\nEmployee privacy \\nTo protect employee data, Continental has established a group-\\nwide management approach that addresses compliance with data \\nprotection regulations, minimizing the risk of data breaches, pro-\\ntecting personal data and promoting awareness of data protection \\nwithin the company. Continental thereby aims to ensure that per-\\nsonal data is processed worldwide in accordance with the following \\ngeneral data protection principles: lawfulness, fairness, transpar-\\nency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy and time-lim-\\nited storage. \\nThe management approach covers Continental’s own employees \\nas well as the personal data relating to potential or former employ-\\nees, customers, suppliers, other business partners, interested par-\\nties and other affected parties. \\nAccountability for the implementation of employee data protection \\nlies with the management of Continentals respective legal entities \\nas well as with functions at all levels that process personal data. The \\nappointed Chief Data Compliance Officer and team are responsible \\nfor defining and implementing the data protection management  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n178\\nframework. The Chief Data Compliance Officer and regional data \\ncompliance coordinators also support the legal entities with the im-\\nplementation. Overarching oversight is exercised by the Executive \\nBoard. \\nThe processes for managing and monitoring the management ap-\\nproach include the following steps as part of a comprehensive data \\nprotection program: secure collection, processing, storage and dis-\\nposal of data. To ensure protection of the data across these steps, \\nContinental has implemented technical and organizational \\nmeasures such as encryption of sensitive data or access controls to \\nprotect data from unauthorized access. Further Continental ad-\\nheres to the principle of data minimization, meaning only collecting \\nand processing the data necessary for specific purposes. A regular \\n“Privacy Impact Assessment” is used to identify critical areas for ac-\\ntion and initiate appropriate measures based on the results. An-\\nother key process within the data protection program is the regular \\ntraining of employees on data protection.  \\nThe management approach is based on the national data protec-\\ntion regulations in the countries Continental operates in as well as \\nthe Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) which are approved by the re-\\nsponsible data protection authority and ensure a level of data pro-\\ntection around the world which corresponds with the EU General \\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR). \\nTo monitor the effectiveness of the program, questions on data \\nprotection are part of both the regular audit questionnaire and the \\nrisk assessment questionnaire. The results of the evaluation are re-\\nported by the Chief Data Compliance Officer to the respective man-\\nagement as well as to the Executive Board. \\nData protection is an integral part of the Code of Conduct for em-\\nployees and is thus firmly anchored in the foundation of coopera-\\ntion at Continental. In addition, a dedicated rule formalizes the pro-\\ncesses in relation to employee privacy. This rule also includes \\nclearly defined BCRs. \\nWith this approach, Continental adheres to relevant data protection \\nregulations such as the EU GDPR.  \\nBy definition, the most important stakeholders with regard to em-\\nployee privacy are Continental’s employees. Their interests are de-\\nfined in the relevant data protection laws. Concerns or complaints \\ncan be submitted via the channels provided for this purpose. The \\nChief Data Compliance Officer and regional data compliance coor-\\ndinators ensure that these concerns are addressed and integrated \\ninto the management approach. \\nContinental informs employees about data protection measures \\nand processes through internal communication channels. The com-\\npliance department manages dedicated formats, including topic-\\nspecific information pages, an internal newsletter and regular training  \\nsessions to keep employees informed and engaged. Additionally, \\nstakeholders involved in the implementation of the management \\napproach receive specialized training and information through \\nstructured meeting formats and relevant rule documents. \\n \\nOccupational safety and health \\nContinental has established a comprehensive management system \\nfor occupational safety and health in order to mitigate the impacts \\non employees in relation to health hazards such as the use of ma-\\nchinery, handling of substances of concern, ergonomics and men-\\ntal hazards. The system is aimed at implementing preventive \\nmeasures and eliminating hazards to ensure the well-being of all \\nemployees. \\nThe management approach covers Continental’s own employees \\ndirectly and non-employee indirectly. \\nAccountability for the safety and health management approach lies \\nwith the management of the respective legal entities, as legally re-\\nquired in most countries. Furthermore, individual accountability \\nplays a crucial role, as every supervisor and employee has a per-\\nsonal responsibility to uphold safety and health practices in their re-\\nspective function. The framework for safety and health is defined \\nby the safety and health organization, which also provides support \\nwith its implementation. Responsibility for the implementation of \\nthe safety and health matters is delegated to the location manag-\\ners who are supported by dedicated ESH managers. Responsibility \\nfor certain specific matters of occupational safety and health is reg-\\nulated individually. Oversight of the overall management approach \\nis exercised by the Executive Board. \\nOccupational safety and health matters are managed through \\nContinental’s ISO 45001-compliant occupational safety and health \\nmanagement system, which comprises processes and programs \\nfor complying with safety and health requirements for all locations. \\nKey elements of this system include specific processes that define \\nthe organization, implementation, reporting and training for rele-\\nvant safety and health topics such as occupational safety, health \\nmanagement, occupational medicine, ergonomics in the workplace \\nand handling of substances of concern (see also the management \\napproach Substances of concern and very high concern in the Pol-\\nlution (ESRS E2) section).  \\nThe processes include establishing a clear structure for allocating \\nresources and defining roles and responsibilities within the organi-\\nzation, risk and impact management for the identification and miti-\\ngation of potential hazards, consistent and transparent communica-\\ntion as well as training and skill development for employees in the \\nindividual topics. Preventive measures are implemented on a site-\\nspecific basis in line with the overall processes. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n179\\nReporting processes have been introduced to monitor the system \\nand internal audits are carried out on a regular basis. To support \\nthis monitoring, Continental has implemented targeted programs \\nsuch as the group sector internal safety & health audit program, to \\ncontrol the compliance with internal standards and identify oppor-\\ntunities for improvement. Furthermore, external ISO 45001 certifi-\\ncations validate the effectiveness of the management system at \\nmany locations. In addition, Continental monitors the effective of \\nthe management system with different metrics reported in the re-\\nspective subsection of this section. \\nThe safety and health management system also includes the dedi-\\ncated management of incidents in the workplace. \\nThe specific processes, responsibilities and monitoring measures \\nare defined in the rules governing occupational safety and health. \\nThe location-specific safety and health management systems fur-\\nther specify the requirements in relation to local needs. \\nIn the development and implementation of the management ap-\\nproach, Continental considers a variety of external standards and \\ncommitments to create alignment with international best practices \\nand legal requirements. Besides ISO 45001 as the international \\nstandard for occupational safety and health management systems, \\nthese include frameworks and standards such as the Luxembourg \\nDeclaration on Workplace Health Promotion in the European Union \\nas well as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration \\non Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and other relevant \\nhuman rights frameworks as outlined in the management ap-\\nproach to labor standards. \\nContinental considers its employees’ interests in alignment with \\nboth internal and external requirements. For this purpose, employ-\\nees and their representatives are involved in the relevant processes \\nto bring in their perspective, e.g. through ESH committees or con-\\nsultations with the works councils.  \\nTo maintain transparency across all levels of the organization, the \\nmanagement approach is communicated via Continental’s internal \\ncommunication platforms. These channels are also actively used to \\nshare information with employees on topics such as ergonomics or \\nmental health and to provide them with personal tools. Another im-\\nportant pillar is training in occupational safety and health, which \\nalso includes mandatory training courses for employees and super-\\nvisors. These are either conducted on site or can be accessed via \\nContinental’s learning platform as presented in the management \\napproach to training and skill development. For additional local \\ncommunication, the EHS managers identify and assess the local re-\\nquirements and advise the location managers. \\nProcesses for engaging with own workers and workers’ \\nrepresentatives about impacts \\nContinental uses various channels to engage with employees in its \\nown workforce. This engagement is part of the continuous devel-\\nopment of the described management approaches. The general \\nprocess for incorporating the perspectives of its own workforce \\ninto the strategy is described in the subsection on Consideration of \\nstakeholder interests and views in the General disclosures (ESRS 2) \\nsection of this sustainability report. \\nContinental implemented comprehensive internal communication \\nthat includes networks for exchange, as well as newsletters, \\nwebcasts and townhall formats to keep employees informed. An \\nimportant format for engaging with the workforce and gaining in-\\nsights into their interests is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey \\nwhere employees provide feedback on different topics related to \\nContinental’s values. These overarching channels are compli-\\nmented by local communication. \\nAdditionally, Continental is in constant dialogue with employee rep-\\nresentatives. In Germany, employee representatives are part of \\nContinental AG’s Supervisory Board. Employees are also repre-\\nsented by local works councils or similar bodies in order to take \\ntheir interests into account in strategic decisions and processes, \\nwherever possible.  \\nEngagement with employees therefore takes place both directly \\nand indirectly via the employee representatives. \\nThe network channels described are continuously open for en-\\ngagement, while formats such as webcasts are held event-based. \\nThe OUR BASICS Live employee survey is conducted annually. \\nFor engaging with marginalized groups in its own workforce, Conti-\\nnental has established dedicated networks. These include for in-\\nstance specific networks for woman, as described in the key ac-\\ntions on the gender diversity target. \\nThe channels are managed by Continentals HR and communica-\\ntion departments across the organization. the Executive Board \\nmember for Group Human Relations (director of labor relations) \\nand Group Sustainability has overarching responsibility and is in-\\nformed by the departments on employees matters. \\nAn important tool for measuring the effectiveness of the engage-\\nment is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey. It records feedback \\non communication and employee involvement and forms the basis \\nfor the metric OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engagement index. \\nThe communication channels also include direct feedback options. \\nFurthermore, the metric on the percentage of employees covered \\nby employee representation serves as an indicator for social dia-\\nlogue coverage. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n180\\nProcesses to remediate negative impacts and channels for own \\nworkforce to raise concerns \\n \\nGrievance channels for own workforce \\nContinental has established dedicated mechanisms to enable its \\nown workforce to raise concerns.\\u2009  \\nThese are part of a comprehensive integrity system that comprises \\nthree channels: an integrity portal, an integrity hotline and an integ-\\nrity email, as described in more detail in the Business conduct and \\ncorporate governance (ESRS G1) section of this sustainability report. \\nEmployees as well as third parties outside the Continental Group \\ncan report violations of legal regulations, fundamental values and \\nethical standards via these channels. The platform and hotline are \\nmanaged by a third-party service provider. The integrity email is \\nmanaged directly by a Continental Case Management team.  \\nThe channels are explicitly open for all employee matters. \\nThe integrity channels can be accessed via our website, internal \\ncommunication channels or an international phone hotline. They \\nare available worldwide in many different languages and accessible \\n24/7, creating broad availability by overcoming barriers such as \\ntime zones or languages. \\nTo raise awareness of the integrity system, Continental has imple-\\nmented various channels and formats, including intranet articles \\nand formats, compliance newsletters and podcasts, mandatory \\ntraining and local on-site communication. Continental does not ex-\\nplicitly assess the awareness and trust of the own workforce in \\nthese channels. \\nIn order to protect users of the integrity system, information on all \\nkinds of potential violation can be reported anonymously. Report-\\ning and investigation information is treated confidentially in accord-\\nance with applicable laws throughout the entire case management. \\nThe whistleblowing process is in line with the German Whistle-\\nblower Protection Act and relevant international legislation. \\nThe integrity system is governed by a dedicated rule that defines \\nroles and responsibilities along the process steps of reporting, re-\\nport administration and substantiation, investigation, and sanction-\\ning – in an end-to-end process. The case management is also sub-\\nject to internal audits. In addition, Continental’s publicly available \\nrules of procedure provide transparency on the handling of cases. \\nFurthermore, Continental’s employees take part in mandatory train-\\nings on the topic of whistleblowing. \\nRemediation processes \\nWhen complaints are received via the whistleblowing channels or \\nthrough audit findings, Continental follows a structured process to \\ninvestigate and address the respective cases. Remedial actions \\nmust be implemented in due time and must be aligned with Conti-\\nnental’s frameworks. Based on these frameworks, the respective le-\\ngal entities must implement measures to resolve the violation effec-\\ntively and prevent similar incidents in the future. The remediation \\nmeasures related to submitted cases are tracked via a compliance \\ncase management software. Further information, including the \\ntracking of effectiveness, can be found in Business conduct and \\ncorporate governance (ESRS G1) section, the management ap-\\nproach Business conduct, corporate governance and corporate cul-\\nture, and in the subsection on Prevention and detection of corrup-\\ntion and bribery which describes the integrity system in detail. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n181\\nTargets Related to Own Workforce \\nWith regard to its own workforce, Continental has set itself a time-\\nbound target related to the matters diversity and gender equality. \\nContinental counts on the diversity of its employees. By this we \\nmean internationality, a balanced gender ratio, and a range of expe-\\nriences and age categories. Diversity is a key driver for different \\nperspectives within the organization and thereby promotes the re-\\nsilience in decision making. In addition, promoting diversity espe-\\ncially on leadership level is also considered to support the preven-\\ntion of discrimination and harassment in the organization. We have \\nset ourselves the public sustainability target of increasing the share \\nof female executives and senior executives to up to 30 % by 2030. \\nAn interim target on the trajectory for the target for 2030 is the \\nshare of 25 % female executives and senior executives by 2025. \\nThe scope of the target comprises all management positions (sen-\\nior executives and executives) worldwide. \\nThis target addresses the overall leadership culture of the company \\nand especially the impacts and risks related to equal treatment and \\ncombating discrimination, as described in the management ap-\\nproach Labor standards in this section. Indirectly it also addresses \\ntopics such as adequate wages and skill development. \\nThe progress of the target achievement is measured with the met-\\nric on gender diversity – share of female and male senior execu-\\ntives and executives. \\nThis metric is monitored continuously and reported at least once a \\nyear. The metric slightly increased in the reporting year to about \\n20.5 % compared to about 19.9 % in the previous year. It is thereby \\nstill within the expected range of the target achievement curve. \\nThe target was defined based on different internal calculations, tak-\\ning into account the related challenges as well as potential. The \\nmetric is calculated based on a defined methodology and has al-\\nready been reported for several years. \\nContinental has set up a dedicated HR community in where HR \\nmanagers can exchange best practices and insights between differ-\\nent teams across the organizational levels. It serves to tailor initia-\\ntives to specific needs and promote the continuous improvement \\nof Continental’s overall diversity and inclusion efforts. \\nEmployee representatives were actively involved in the target-set-\\nting process. \\nThe involvement of the affected interest groups, the identification \\nof lessons learned and potential for improvement, e.g. via networks, \\nis presented in the key actions for target achievement. \\nThe target has not been changed during the reporting period. \\n \\nKey Actions for Target Achievement \\nThe key actions to implement the “Women in management posi-\\ntions” target include a set of initiatives and programs. Given the na-\\nture of the target, promoting diversity is also an important manage-\\nment task in addition to the key actions. \\nContinental has taken market analyses into account when defining \\nappropriate actions. This includes, for example, a partnership with a \\nprofessor of economics who assists with the analysis of HR data \\nand survey results to identify key insights and areas for improve-\\nment. This collaboration provides valuable knowledge and a basis \\nfor identifying and refining actions. \\nThe defined levers that have been implemented to achieve the tar-\\nget of women in management positions focus on improving the \\nstructural conditions to level the playing field for women. These in-\\nclude increasing flexibility through offers like childcare, mobile work \\nor part time options, as well as the use of objective and diagnostics-\\nassisted recruitment and training procedures. To create a culture of \\ninclusion and belonging, Continental promotes awareness and edu-\\ncation on these topics through leadership philosophy and develop-\\nment as well as guidelines on diversity and anti-discrimination. \\nContinental has also launched specific initiatives for women to pro-\\nmote their professional development. These include, e.g. events, of-\\nfers for talent management and development as well as networks. \\nThese measures are not only aimed at the achievement of the tar-\\nget but are also support the prevention of discrimination and \\nachieving equal treatment of employees in general. \\nBy mitigating the underlying negative impacts, it is assumed that \\nthe measures also mitigate to some extent potential risks to the \\ncompany arising from possible incidents of discrimination in the \\narea of gender diversity. \\nNo material positive impacts related to anti-discrimination and di-\\nversity were identified. \\nAlso, no material opportunities have been identified. \\nKey resources for the action plan include the expenditure for im-\\nproving the structural conditions and specific initiatives for women. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n182\\nThe actions related to the target for gender diversity support the \\nmanagement approach to Labor standards by striving to reduce \\npotential negative impacts on the own workforce, also in the event \\nof conflicting economic and social interests. \\nThe specific initiatives for women focus on the entire female work-\\nforce, also beyond management positions. The actions relating to \\nthe structural conditions are much broader and ultimately address \\nthe entire workforce.  \\nThe actions include short-, medium- and long-term measures. \\nThe key actions for target achievement are not directly related to a \\nspecific remedial process. Where relevant, remedial actions are \\nbased on the general processes, as described for the integrity sys-\\ntem. \\nThe effectiveness of the actions related to the impacts and risks is \\nmeasured indirectly through the target achievement progress and \\nthe pool of potential candidates. \\n \\n \\nCapital expenditures and operating expenditures for key actions to achieve the target related to the own workforce \\n \\n \\nOpEx for key actions \\n2024 \\nOpEx for key actions to achieve the target related to own \\nworkforce, in € millions \\n13 \\n \\n \\nDefinitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: \\n- The data for operating expenditure (OpEx) related to the improvement of structural \\nconditions and specific initiatives for women is collected by the legal entities of the \\nContinental Group. \\nPlanned OpEx for key actions \\nNext \\n5 years \\nPlanned OpEx for key actions to achieve the target related to \\nown workforce, in € millions \\n67 \\n \\n \\nDefinitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: \\n- The time horizon applied is in line with the approved long-term planning.  \\n- The data for operating expenditure (OpEx) related to the improvement of structural \\nconditions and specific initiatives for women is collected at Group level based on the \\noperating expenditure incurred in the reporting year in accordance with the table above.  \\nCapEx for key actions \\n2024 \\nCapEx for key actions to achieve the target related to own \\nworkforce, in € millions \\n0 \\n \\n \\nDefinitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: \\n- The data for capital expenditure (CapEx) related to the improvement of structural \\nconditions and specific initiatives for women is collected by the legal entities of the \\nContinental Group. \\nPlanned CapEx for key actions \\nNext \\n5 years \\nPlanned CapEx for key actions to achieve the target related to \\nown workforce, in € millions \\n2 \\nDefinitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: \\n- The time horizon applied is in line with the approved long-term planning. \\n- The data on capital expenditure (CapEx) related to the improvement of structural \\nconditions and specific initiatives for women is collected at Group level based on the \\noperating expenditure incurred in the reporting year in accordance with the table above. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n183\\nMetrics Related to Own Workforce \\nCharacteristics of the company’s employees \\n \\nOwn employees (headcount) \\nIn the economic report within the management report, the number \\nof employees is disclosed in the Earnings position section in the  \\nEmployees subsection.

These negative impacts \\nare associated with Continental’s strategy and business model and \\nrelate in particular to regions, certain markets, industries and busi-\\nness activities in the supplier base that are critically or significantly \\nexposed to such impacts. The identified actual and potential im-\\npacts on workers in the value chain are important for adapting the \\nstrategy and business model. The development of measures and \\nstrategic decisions based on the identified impacts are described \\nas part of the management approach. \\nAs indicated by the respective descriptions, all identified risks result \\ndirectly from identified actual and potential impacts. They are \\ntherefore also based on the breadth and diversity of countries, mar-\\nkets, industries and business activities in Continental’s value chain. \\nTherefore, the risks are inherently linked to Continental’s strategy \\nand business model. \\nThe assessment of material impacts takes into account all workers \\nin the value chain but is explicitly focused on workers in Conti-\\nnental’s supply chain. Connections to the company’s own opera-\\ntions, product portfolio and business relationships are taken into ac-\\ncount where relevant.  \\nAs Continental sources goods, materials and services from numer-\\nous industries along the value chain, this essentially has an actual \\nor potential impact on all types of workers. Workers who work on \\nContinental’s premises but are not counted as part of the com-\\npany’s own workforce, as well as workers who work for direct sup-\\npliers or indirect suppliers in the deeper value chain, are considered \\nto be particularly affected. In both cases, this includes vulnerable \\ngroups such as migrant workers. The impacts on workers in the \\ndownstream value chain are rather considered as indirect. Workers \\nin Continental’s joint ventures are especially impacted if the joint \\nventure is also a supplier. \\nContinental’s assessment of the impacts, risks and opportunities \\ndid not focus on workers in the value chain with specific character-\\nistics or in specific activities and contexts, and accordingly did not \\nprovide an understanding of a greater exposure to harm.  \\nThese specifics include the fact that Continental’s global value \\nchain includes many industries, countries and markets and thus \\nalso regions in which there is a significant potential for negative im-\\npacts with regard to child labor, forced labor or compulsory labor, \\nin particular in Pakistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \\nor industries such as the quarrying of stone, sand and clay or grow-\\ning of perennial crops. \\nThe assessment of the material negative impacts regarding work-\\ners in the value chain was integrated in the general impact, risk and \\nopportunity assessment following the defined methodology. The \\nmethodology takes into consideration two perspectives: All nega-\\ntive impacts are to be considered widespread or systemic as they \\nrelate to countries, certain markets, industries and business activi-\\nties or other business relationships in Continental’s value chain. In \\naddition, the methodology takes into account actual event-based \\nnegative impacts wherever the impact description contains a refer-\\nence to concrete actual incidents. \\nMaterial risks arising from the impacts on workers in the value \\nchain are not attributable to specific groups of people but are de-\\npendent on industries and geographical aspects. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n191\\nManagement Approach to Workers in the Value Chain \\nThis subsection describes the management approach that Conti-\\nnental established in order to address the material impacts on the \\nworkers in the value chain as well as the associated material risks.  \\nWith this management approach, Continental is pursuing the ambi-\\ntion of creating a 100 % responsible value chain by 2050 at the lat-\\nest. The “Responsible Value Chain Due Diligence System” (RVCDDS) \\nimplemented for this purpose aims to protect both human and en-\\nvironmental rights along the value chain. It formulates the “Respon-\\nsible Value Chain Commitments” (RVC commitments) in the areas \\nof labor standards, occupational safety and health, environment, se-\\ncurity practices and land rights, which apply to Continental’s direct \\nsuppliers. \\nWith the RVC commitments, the RVCDDS explicitly addresses re-\\nspect for human rights, particularly with the RVC commitments in \\nthe area of labor standards. \\nThe safety of workers, precarious working conditions, trafficking in \\nhuman beings, forced labor (including debt bondage) and child la-\\nbor are also addressed by Continental’s RVC commitments and \\nBusiness Partner Code of Conduct. \\nThe management approach encompasses all purchasing activities \\nof Continental and its subsidiaries worldwide in which the Conti-\\nnental Group exercises a controlling influence. The focus is on the \\ndirect suppliers, including service providers such as security ser-\\nvices or waste management services. Indirectly and on an ad hoc \\nbasis, the deeper supply chain is also taken into account. Specific \\nelements of the RVCDDS, in particular the integrity system, are \\naimed at workers along the entire value chain. This is described in \\ngreater detail in the subsection Processes to remediate negative \\nimpacts and channels for workers in the value chain to raise con-\\ncerns of this section. Further specifics of the management ap-\\nproach apply to the natural rubber supply chain. \\nOverall accountability for the RVCDDS, including the RVC commit-\\nments, lies with the Executive Board. The latter has appointed a re-\\nsponsible value chain officer who manages the system and dele-\\ngates responsibility for the supply chain-related framework to the \\npurchasing functions. The tasks and processes defined in the sys-\\ntem in relation to the supply chain are implemented by the respec-\\ntive purchasing departments. \\nThe system comprises many processes, such as strategy develop-\\nment and implementation, the management of regulations, impact \\nand risk management, case management (including the integrity \\nsystem) and training. To monitor the effectiveness of the system, a \\nmulti-stage process is implemented that includes three lines. With \\nregard to the supply chain, the first line is made up of the individual \\npurchasing functions that implement the operational tasks in  \\naccordance with the RVCDDS. The second line, represented by non-\\noperational purchasing functions and roles, oversees the system, \\nroles and responsibilities as well as their effectiveness. The third line \\nis Continental’s internal audit function, which performs an inde-\\npendent assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the \\nRVCDDS. \\nSpecific preventive and remedial measures in relation to the supply \\nchain are the alignment of procurement strategies and practices, \\nthe definition of contractual agreements, the introduction of control \\nmechanisms and the training of purchasers and suppliers. Conti-\\nnental also employs a supplier selection process based on criteria \\nsuch as quality standards, financial stability, production capacity, \\nsustainability criteria and compliance with legal and ethical stand-\\nards. Selected suppliers are continuously assessed using self-as-\\nsessment questionnaires, which Continental collects via the gener-\\nally accepted sustainability platforms EcoVadis and NQC. Selective \\nlocal audits or other audit activities are also carried out, such as in \\nrelation to the implementation of the ESH management systems.  \\nAs part of an annual review process with the Executive Board, the \\noverall RVCDDS, including the specific processes for labor stand-\\nards, is evaluated in terms of effectiveness, adequacy and potential \\nfor improvement. The RVCDDS is additionally integrated into Conti-\\nnental’s overarching internal control system, the risk management \\nsystem and compliance management system. \\nBesides the definition of preventive measures in relation to direct \\nsuppliers, the RVCDDS also defines the framework for remedial \\nmeasures vis-à-vis direct suppliers and, event-based also vis-à-vis in-\\ndirect suppliers. Remedial measures are documented and opera-\\ntionalized by means of the suppliers’ corrective action plans and \\ncan include additional findings from suppliers’ sustainability audits. \\nThe processes described are formalized by a dedicated rule for the \\nRVCDDS as well as subsequent purchasing-specific rules that define \\nthe application of the processes for supplier relationships. Direct \\nsuppliers are guided by the binding Business Partner Code of Con-\\nduct (BPCoC), which refers to the RVC commitments. For suppliers \\nof natural rubber, an additional rule on the purchasing of sustaina-\\nble natural rubber applies. \\nThe management approach for workers in the value chain is based \\non international standards and obligations. These include the Inter-\\nnational Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Prin-\\nciples and Rights at Work, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational \\nEnterprises, the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business \\nand Human Rights and the International Bill of Human Rights. Mon-\\nitoring of the adherence to these standards is anchored in the \\nRVCDDS review process, including a revision of its rules and pro-\\ncesses, if required. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n192\\nThe established international standards on human rights including \\nthe UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights are key \\nreferences for internal rules.  \\nThe described established processes for the fulfillment of due dili-\\ngence support the detection of actual negative impacts on human \\nrights and violations of international norms and standards and ena-\\nble Continental to act upon these with its business partners. Identi-\\nfied and confirmed cases are named in the respective impact de-\\nscriptions.  \\nThe interests of stakeholders are an important perspective for \\nshaping the RVCDDS. To gain insights into the interests of workers \\nin the value chain, Continental maintains partnerships and is in-\\nvolved in associations such as econsense, the Responsible Busi-\\nness Alliance (RBA), Rubberway, “Deutsche Gesellschaft für Interna-\\ntionale Zusammenarbeit” (GIZ) (German Agency for International \\nCooperation) and the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rub-\\nber (GPSNR). The integration of these interests into the system is \\ncarried out as part of the annual review process. \\nContinental communicates its management approach through the \\nexternally published RVC commitments and the Public Policy \\nStatement. Training initiatives for suppliers are also carried out to \\nfurther promote shared responsibility along the entire value chain. \\nIn addition, direct suppliers are requested to sign the Business \\nPartner Code of Conduct. The communication is thus aimed at af-\\nfected stakeholders as well as stakeholders involved in the imple-\\nmentation. \\n \\nProcesses for engaging with value chain workers about \\nimpacts \\nThe engagement with workers in the value chain is part of the con-\\ntinuous development of the management approach described. \\nA key element of this is the participation in dialogue formats of  \\nassociations and initiatives with external stakeholders, such as the \\nsector dialogue for the automotive industry and the dialogue with \\nlabor unions. Participation in and maintenance of these dialogue \\nformats take place on a continuous basis. If required, topic- or \\nevent-specific discussions take place. The knowledge thus gained \\nabout the interests of workers in the value chain supports the  \\ndevelopment of a shared understanding of industry-related risks \\nand impacts on stakeholders and the resulting due diligence  \\nobligations. \\nThe processes and activities regarding the detection and mitigation \\nof negative impacts are managed through the RVCDDS and also \\ninclude cases that are reported by workers in the value chain via \\nContinental’s integrity system. The integrity system is described in \\nmore detail in the subsection Processes to remediate negative  \\nimpacts and channels for workers in the value chain to raise con-\\ncerns in this section. This is a form of direct engagement with af-\\nfected stakeholders, in addition to the participation in initiatives \\nand associations.  \\nGovernance and responsibility for the processes are regulated \\nwithin the RVCDDS as described in the management approach. The \\nannual review process anchored in the RVCDDS includes a consoli-\\ndation and analysis of relevant information. As an integral part of \\nthis, the actual negative impacts identified via the bottom-up im-\\npact and risk analysis, as well as case management, are reviewed, \\nand the effectiveness of the established processes is monitored.  \\nThe engagement with particularly vulnerable workers in the value \\nchain is addressed mostly indirectly, e.g. by the RVC commitment \\non equal treatment. \\n \\nProcesses to remediate negative impacts and channels for \\nworkers in the value chain to raise concerns \\n \\nGrievance channels for value chain workers \\nContinental has established dedicated mechanisms to enable workers \\nin the value chain to raise concerns.\\u2009 \\nThese are part of a comprehensive integrity system that comprises \\nthree channels: an integrity portal, an integrity hotline and an integrity \\ne-mail address, as described in more detail in the Business conduct \\nand corporate governance (ESRS G1) section. Employees as well as \\nthird parties outside the Continental Group can report violations of le-\\ngal regulations, fundamental values and ethical standards via these \\nchannels. The platform and hotline are managed by an external ser-\\nvice provider, while the integrity e-mail is managed directly by a Conti-\\nnental case management team. \\nThe integrity channels can be accessed through our website or via an \\ninternational phone hotline and are explicitly also open for workers in \\nthe value chain. They are available worldwide in many different lan-\\nguages and accessible 24/7, creating broad availability by overcom-\\ning barriers such as time zones or languages. \\nThe integrity system is governed by a dedicated rule that defines roles \\nand responsibilities along the process steps of reporting, report ad-\\nministration and substantiation, investigation, and sanctioning – in an \\nend-to-end process. The case management is also subject to internal \\naudits. In addition, Continental’s publicly available rules of procedure \\nprovide transparency on the handling of cases. Further information on \\ntracking reported cases and ensuring process effectiveness can be \\nfound in the Business conduct and corporate governance (ESRS G1) \\nsection in this sustainability report.  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n193\\nTo raise awareness of the integrity system, the Business Partner Code \\nof Conduct contains a section on the complaint mechanisms. In addi-\\ntion, the channels are mentioned in supplier training on the topic of re-\\nsponsible value chains. Continental does not explicitly assess the \\nawareness and trust of workers in the value chain in these channels. \\nIn order to protect users of the integrity system, information on all \\nkinds of potential violation can be reported anonymously. Reporting \\nand investigation information is treated confidentially in accordance \\nwith applicable laws throughout the entire management of the case. \\nThe whistleblowing process is in line with the German Whistleblower \\nProtection Act and relevant international legislation. \\nRemediation processes \\nWhen complaints are received via the whistleblowing channels or \\nthrough audit findings, Continental follows a structured process to \\ninvestigate and address the respective cases. If the violation occurs \\nwithin the value chain, Continental collaborates closely with the re-\\nspective business partner to resolve the violation effectively and \\nprevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. For this pur-\\npose, e.g. corrective action plans are created together with the busi-\\nness partner. The effectiveness of the remedy is assessed through \\naudits, internal investigations, and the implementation of corrective \\naction plans. \\n \\n \\nTargets Related to Workers in the Value Chain  \\nContinental has defined a systematic process for setting targets. \\nWith regard to workers in the value chain, it was decided to pursue \\nthe management approach described and not to set a time-bound \\nsustainability target.

The descriptions of the negative impacts and risks are \\npresented from a gross perspective which, on the basis of the ap-\\nplied methodology, does not take into account mitigation through \\nthe management approaches of Continental as described in the re-\\nspective IRO cluster.

These are described at the \\nbeginning of the section. These negative impacts are linked to \\nContinental’s strategy and business model and relate in particular \\nto countries, certain markets and industries of the supplier base \\nand Continental’s own operations, which are exposed to such im-\\npacts to a critical or significant extent.\\u2009  \\nThe development of measures and strategic decisions based on \\nthe impacts identified is described in this sustainability report as \\npart of the management approaches Environmental protection in \\nown operations, Environmental protection in the supply chain, and \\nSubstances of concern and very high concern in the Pollution \\n(ESRS E2) section as well as Labor standards in the Own workforce \\n(ESRS S1) section and in the Workers in the value chain (ESRS S2) \\nsection. \\nThe identified risk is not related to a dependency on affected com-\\nmunities, but rather to geographical and industry-related aspects. \\nAs indicated by the description, it results directly from the identified \\npotential impacts and is also based on the breadth and diversity of \\ncountries, markets and industries in Continental’s own operations \\nand supplier base.  \\nThe risk is therefore inherently linked to Continental’s strategy and \\nbusiness model. \\nAs Continental sources goods, materials and services from numer-\\nous industries along the value chain, this essentially has potential \\nimpacts on all types of affected communities. Communities living \\nor working near Continental sites or near to companies in Conti-\\nnental’s supply chain are considered to be particularly affected. In \\nboth cases, this also includes indigenous people. The impacts on \\ncommunities in the downstream value chain are rather considered \\nas indirect.  \\nContinental’s assessment of the impacts, risks and opportunities \\ndid not focus on affected communities with specific characteristics \\nor in specific activities and contexts, and accordingly did not pro-\\nvide an understanding of specific exposure to harm. \\nThe assessment of the material negative impacts regarding own \\nworkforce was integrated in the general impact, risk and oppor-\\ntunity assessment following the defined methodology.  \\nAll negative impacts are considered widespread or systemic as \\nthey relate to countries, certain markets and industries in Conti-\\nnental’s own operations or supplier base. In addition, the methodol-\\nogy takes into account event-based actual negative impacts wher-\\never the impact description contains a reference to concrete actual \\nincidents. \\nThe assessment of potential material impacts on affected commu-\\nnities in general considers the entire value chain but is explicitly fo-\\ncused on the supply chain. Connections to the company’s own op-\\nerations, product portfolio and business relationships are taken into \\naccount where relevant. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n197\\nManagement Approach to Affected Communities \\nContinental’s approach to managing material impacts and risks that \\nmay also affect communities is covered by the following manage-\\nment approaches, which are described elsewhere in this sustaina-\\nbility report: \\n› Environmental protection in own operations with regard to poten-\\ntial impacts from pollution caused by the own operations (see the \\nPollution (ESRS E2) section). \\n› Environmental protection in the supply chain with regard to po-\\ntential impacts due to pollution caused by suppliers (see the Pol-\\nlution (ESRS E2) section). \\n› Substances of concern and very high concern with regard to po-\\ntential impacts due to their use in own operations, the upstream \\nvalue chain and the downstream value chain (see the Pollution \\n(ESRS E2) section).  \\n› Labor standards with a more detailed description of the Respon-\\nsible Value Chain Due Diligence System (RVCDDS) and the pro-\\ncesses for own operations (see the Own workforce (ESRS S1) sec-\\ntion). These also include the Responsible Value Chain Commit-\\nments (RVC commitments) in relation to land rights, including the \\nrights of indigenous people and responsible security practices. \\n› Workers in the value chain in which the RVCDDS and its pro-\\ncesses for the supply chain are described in detail (see the Work-\\ners in the value chain (ESRS S2) section). \\nThe focus of the management approaches and the RVCDDS in par-\\nticular is on own operations and direct suppliers, and therefore on \\naffected communities in their vicinity. Indirectly and on an ad hoc \\nbasis, the deeper supply chain is also taken into account. Specific \\nelements of the RVCDDS, in particular the integrity system and the \\nassociated case management, are aimed directly at all affected \\ncommunities along the value chain. \\nAs part of the RVCDDS, in addition to the RVC commitments de-\\nscribed in the management approaches mentioned, Continental \\ncommits to respect legitimate land rights throughout the entire life \\ncycle of a property or other use of land, forests and water, espe-\\ncially where these secure the livelihoods of people. \\nWith regard to responsible security practices, Continental commits \\nto respecting human rights when contracting or using its own, pri-\\nvate or public security forces and to ensure sufficient instructions \\nand establish appropriate control mechanisms. \\nThe instruments of the RVCDDS regarding preventive and remedial \\nmeasures, communication and alignment with internationally rec-\\nognized standards and the system review, as described in the man-\\nagement approaches, include the company’s own workforce, work-\\ners in the value chain as well as affected communities. \\n \\nProcesses for engaging with affected communities about \\nimpacts \\nAs described for the following management approaches, Conti-\\nnental engages with affected communities at local level and has \\nalso established generally accessible channels for complaints. \\nThe interests of affected stakeholders are an important perspective \\nfor the further development of the management approaches Envi-\\nronmental protection in own operations (see the Pollution (ESRS \\nE2) section), Environmental protection in the supply chain (see the \\nPollution (ESRS E2) section), Labor standards (see the Own Work-\\nforce (ESRS S1) section) and Workforce in the value chain (see the \\nWorkforce in the Value Chain (ESRS S2) section). This may also in-\\nclude direct exchange with affected communities or their repre-\\nsentatives, e.g. through partnerships and dialogue with associa-\\ntions. This stakeholder engagement, also in terms of timing, type, \\nfrequency, responsibility and monitoring of effectiveness, is de-\\nscribed in the management approaches listed above. \\nThe outlined processes of engagement include all types of affected \\ncommunities, including indigenous people. Beyond the general pro-\\ncesses, there are no specific processes for engagement with indige-\\nnous people or for the provision of remedial measures. \\n \\nProcesses to remediate negative impacts and channels for \\naffected communities to raise concerns \\nContinental has set up general channels for the raising of com-\\nplaints, which can also be used by affected communities.\\u2009 \\nThese channels are part of a comprehensive integrity system that \\nis explained in detail in the Business conduct and corporate gov-\\nernance (ESRS G1) section of this sustainability report. The chan-\\nnels described are also explicitly open to members of affected com-\\nmunities or their representatives. The defined roles and responsibil-\\nities along the process steps of reporting, report administration and \\nsubstantiation, investigation, and sanctioning apply equally for all \\ncases submitted by them. There are no specific mechanisms for ap-\\nplying remedial measures for affected communities. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n198\\nThe channels are communicated via the external communication \\nplatforms and mentioned in supplier training sessions on the topic \\nof responsible value chains. Further, Continentals Business Partner \\nCode of Conduct comprises a chapter on complaint mechanisms, \\nwhich helps to raise awareness about Continentals integrity system. \\nContinental does not explicitly assess the awareness and trust of af-\\nfected communities in these channels. \\nIn order to protect users of the integrity system, information on all \\nkinds of potential violation can be reported anonymously. Report-\\ning and investigation information is treated confidentially in accord-\\nance with applicable laws throughout the entire management of \\nthe case. The whistleblowing process is in line with the German \\nWhistleblower Protection Act and relevant international legislation. \\nTargets Related to Affected Communities \\nContinental has defined a systematic process for setting targets. \\nWith regard to affected communities, it was decided to pursue the \\nmanagement approaches described and not to set a time-bound \\nsustainability target. The monitoring of effectiveness and the track-\\ning of progress are described in the related management ap-\\nproaches and reported metrics. \\nKey Actions for Target Achievement \\nIn Continental’s view, key actions to be reported relate directly to \\ncorresponding targets, where available.

This perspective is used to determine where appropri-\\nate management approaches are relevant and corresponding re-\\nporting is required. As positive impacts and opportunities are \\nstrengthened by Continental’s management approaches, the de-\\nscriptions are presented from a net perspective which, for methodi-\\ncal reasons, considers the results of the management approaches. \\nThe descriptions of the IROs are to be regarded as self-contained, \\nwhich may result in repetitions. \\nTechnical and product compliance \\n› Continental has recorded individual quality incidents in 2024 \\nwhich are assumed to have limited impacts on the personal \\nsafety of consumers. Beyond the confirmed incidents, and in par-\\nticular considering potential quality defects or misuse of Conti-\\nnental’s products, significant negative impacts on the personal \\nsafety of consumers and end-users of Continental’s products \\ncould occur if not adequately managed or prevented. (see ESRS \\n2, IRO table, impact 66) \\n› Some of Continental’s products, applications and services process \\nand handle consumers’ and end-users' data (e.g. from connected \\nphones, addresses). Therefore, incidents with significant negative \\nimpacts related to violations of data protection rights can occur if \\nthese are not adequately prevented or mitigated. (see ESRS 2, \\nIRO table, impact 68) \\n› Given the broadness of Continental’s portfolio of components and \\nsystems for vehicles and industrial applications relevant to con-\\nsumers’ personal safety and the considerable increase in regula-\\ntions and market trends relating to consumer protection and \\nproduct safety, Continental could face significant sales losses in \\nthe respective businesses, especially in the medium term, if the \\nspeed of change exceeds the speed of adaptation. (see ESRS 2, \\nIRO table, risk 69) \\n› Continental operates in industries and has a portfolio where inci-\\ndents related to product safety, technical standards and require-\\nments for consumers and end-users can occur. If, in the worst-\\ncase scenario, Continental’s prevention processes were to fail and \\nrelated severe incidents were to occur, Continental could face \\nsanctions with significant penalties and fines, remedy costs or \\neven business-on-hold for the respective businesses, especially in \\nthe medium term. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, risk 70) \\nSafe mobility \\n› Continental’s product portfolio includes numerous safety-relevant \\nproducts (e.g. brakes, sensors, tires) which are constantly evolving \\nand therefore presumably have a substantive positive impact on \\nthe personal safety of consumers and end-users and put pressure \\non markets and other market participants to continuously im-\\nprove. (see ESRS 2, IRO table, impact 67) \\n› Continental’s product portfolio serves markets which are trans-\\nforming because of further increasing regulatory requirements \\nand market trends related to safety and consumer protection. \\nThis can lead to changing requirements for certain products and \\ninnovations of Continental. If Continental is able to utilize these \\nmarket drivers effectively, specific businesses activities (especially \\ntires and brakes) can profit directly or indirectly from substantial \\ngrowth opportunities or even new business fields/models in the \\nlong term.

In addition, in the industrial application \\nenvironment there are different types of industrial workers being di-\\nrectly or indirectly users of industrial applications containing Conti-\\nnental’s components and systems. \\nThe consumers and end-users subject to the identified impacts \\ncomprise consumers and end-users of products which, as de-\\nscribed in the impacts, are inherently relevant regarding potential \\nharm to their personal safety. The identified impacts also cover \\nconsumers and end-users of products and services which are rele-\\nvant regarding potential negative impacts on privacy rights (e.g. \\npersonal data). \\nConsumers and end-users who are dependent on accurate and ac-\\ncessible product or service information as well as consumers and \\nend-users who are particularly vulnerable to health or privacy im-\\npacts or impacts from marketing and sales strategies (e.g. children) \\nare not in focus of the identified impacts but may nevertheless be \\nend-users especially of vehicle components. \\nIn general, the identified actual and potential impacts are industry- \\nand portfolio-inherent and therefore considered systemic. Never-\\ntheless, the actual impacts are incident-based.  \\nThe assessment of the material negative impacts on consumers \\nand/or end-users was integrated in the general impact, risk and op-\\nportunity assessment following the defined methodology. The \\nmethodology takes into consideration both perspectives: All nega-\\ntive impacts are considered widespread or systemic as they are re-\\nlated to Continental’s operations, sourcing or other business rela-\\ntionships. This also includes event-based impacts on the personal \\nsafety of consumers and end-users of Continental´s products or \\npotential violations of their data privacy rights. In addition, the \\nmethodology factors in event-based actual negative impacts, e.g. \\nconcrete recorded quality incidents. \\nThe identified material positive impact relates to Continental's prod-\\nucts (e.g. driver assistance systems, brake systems or tire pressure \\nmonitoring systems) for the safety of consumers and end-users \\nwhile driving or in other traffic situations. \\nIn general, the identified impacts, risks and opportunities include all \\nconsumers and end-users. \\nContinental’s assessment of the impacts, risks and opportunities \\ndid not focus on consumers or end-users with particular character-\\nistics and correspondingly did not provide an understanding of po-\\ntential specific negative impacts. Based on the IRO assessment in \\nContinental’s interpretation, the assessment of actual and potential \\nnegative impacts in particular through Continental’s products, sys-\\ntems and services for vehicles has the potential to affect every user \\nof vehicles worldwide as an end-user.  \\nThe identified material risks related to impacts and dependencies \\non consumers and/or end-users are related to all consumers and/or \\nend-users. \\n \\n \\n\", \" \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n201\\nManagement Approaches to Consumers and End-Users \\nTechnical and product compliance \\nTechnical compliance means that all products (system, hardware, \\nsoftware and/or services) comply with the specifications placed on \\nthem and meet the applicable mandatory product requirements. \\nTechnical compliance obligations are generally contained in statu-\\ntory technical regulations, external standards (national/interna-\\ntional), applicable internal rules, technical customer requirements \\ncontractually agreed upon as well as in the externally communi-\\ncated voluntary commitments of Continental. \\nThe main objective of Continental’s management approach to \\nTechnical and product compliance is to ensure the technical com-\\npliance of our products, including systems, hardware, software \\nand/or services. Five categories of technical compliance are taken \\ninto consideration in this respect: product safety, product conform-\\nity, environmental conformity of products, cybersecurity of prod-\\nucts, data protection and intellectual property. At the same time, \\nthe management approach aims to protect Continental and its em-\\nployees from possible negative consequences and risks that any \\ndeviation from the technical compliance may cause. \\nTo ensure technical compliance in all five categories, Continental \\nhas established a technical Compliance Management System \\n(tCMS) as a binding set of rules integrated into Continental’s man-\\nagement system. \\nThe management approach covers the Continental Group world-\\nwide as well as the entire product life cycle and all related functions. \\nThus, it also covers all products and services of Continental and \\ntherefore, all consumers and end-users of these products and ser-\\nvices are as well indirectly covered. \\nContinental’s governance and accountability with regards to tech-\\nnical compliance follow a three-lines-approach. In the first line, the \\naccountability for the execution lies with the operational functions \\nat the level of the group sectors, business areas, legal entities, \\nplants and other locations. These operational functions include \\namong others research & development (R&D), engineering, sales, \\npurchasing, manufacturing, after-sales and marketing. In the sec-\\nond line, the governance framework and operational oversight are \\nexercised by technical compliance functions and roles (e.g. within \\nquality, intellectual property and R&D). The third line is the inde-\\npendent internal audit function. The management approach is su-\\npervised by the Executive Board. Each line performs specific tasks, \\nhas explicit responsibilities and is assigned to different areas within \\nthe organization. As the central requirement, independence of the \\nindividual lines is ensured through organizational separation. \\nThe tCMS within Continental comprises a large number of pro-\\ncesses related to technical compliance (tC): \\n› tC case management, which deals with the management of tC \\nproblems that occur when the product is in the field, i.e. already in \\nuse or no longer under the management control of Continental. It \\nincludes the identification of tC problems, their initial assessment, \\nanalysis, mitigation of problems, prevention of recurrence, closure \\nof problem cases, lessons learned, and an audit after works com-\\npletion. \\n› tC clearing management, which deals with the management of tC \\nproblems that occur before the product is in the field or while it is \\nstill under the management control of Continental. \\n› identification and implementation of tC obligations, a defined pro-\\ncess for the identification of our technical compliance obligations, \\ni.e. mandatory requirements for Continental's products and ser-\\nvices, and providing these requirements in a traceable form for \\nimplementation. \\n› tC risk management for determining tC risks and ensuring their \\nmanagement and monitoring along the entire product life cycle. \\n› tC business partner integrity management to ensure the tech-\\nnical compliance of suppliers, other third-party providers as well \\nas minority holdings of Continental, including associates and joint \\nventures without management control which supply materials or \\ncomponents for use in Continental’s products, and providers of \\ngoods and services. \\n› tCMS monitoring and reporting, to ensure that the tCMS is ade-\\nquately monitored and that tC-related information is collected, \\ndocumented, communicated and made available to the relevant \\nstakeholders at every level of the organization. \\nThe tCMS is implemented in a close collaboration between Group, \\nall group sectors, business areas, segments, functions and regions. \\nCentral tCMS teams ensure that all categories and aspects are cov-\\nered and synergies are realized. \\nThe metrics related to consumers and end-users “Coverage of qual-\\nity management systems” and “New field quality events” track \\nContinental’s efforts in securing technical and product compliance. \\n\", ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n202\\nAs part of an annual review process, the Executive Board of Conti-\\nnental is updated on the current status of the tCMS and decides on \\nthe system’s adequacy and potential for improvement. Further-\\nmore, the tCMS is integrated into Continental’s overarching internal \\ncontrol system, the risk management system and the compliance \\nmanagement system. \\nThe tCMS is documented in a dedicated internal rule. Additional in-\\nternal rules relevant for technical compliance cover in particular \\nspecific design standards and testing procedures.  \\nThe tCMS was developed on the basis of industry standards such \\nas IDW PS 980 and ISO 37301 and is compliant with those. Conti-\\nnental’s technical compliance standards focus on compliance with \\nlegal technical regulations (LTRs) as well as applicable national and \\ninternational standards (NIS) related to product safety, product con-\\nformity, environmental requirements to products, product cyberse-\\ncurity and data protection. In addition, the standards also consider \\ncontractually agreed technical requirements of customers with re-\\ngard to legal technical obligations relevant for them, applicable ex-\\nternal standards as well as internal rules of the customers as bind-\\ning product requirements. These include, for example, specific \\nproduct certification and material or emission limits that apply to \\nthe overall system, e.g. a complete vehicle. \\nIn the technical compliance environment, the interests of stake-\\nholders are to a major extent covered indirectly through compre-\\nhensive regulatory requirements and requirements imposed by the \\nstandards. This also includes the interests of consumers and end-\\nusers. Key direct stakeholders are customers and authorities. Close \\ndialogue with these stakeholders is a key element of the manage-\\nment approach. \\nContinental communicates its management approach externally \\nand internally. The responsible employees are trained in technical \\ncompliance. There are numerous further communication formats \\n(such as open calls) to promote the management approach. \\n \\nSafe mobility \\nWith technological solutions aiming at zero road traffic accidents \\nand fatalities, Continental strives for maximum safety in mobility. \\nThis ambition is deeply rooted in the company culture and re-\\nflected by the broad product portfolio of safety-relevant products \\n(e.g. brakes, sensors, driver assistant systems, tires). The focus of \\nthe Continental’s management approach related to safe mobility is \\ntherefore the fulfillment of this ambition, mitigation of the related \\nrisks and facilitation of the profitable business with safety-relevant \\nproducts. \\nIn general, the management approach covers Continental’s entire \\nportfolio, but is geared especially towards the safety-relevant prod-\\nucts. It encompasses all groups of consumers or end-users rather \\nthan focusing on any specific group.  \\nSafety-relevant products include, for example, the following prod-\\nucts: \\n› Efficient brake systems are essential for controlling vehicle move-\\nment, predictive and preventive safety functions, safe infrastruc-\\nture solutions and advanced driver assistance systems. \\n› Tires are the only point of contact between a vehicle and the \\nroad. In a critical situation, it is the tire that determines whether \\nthe vehicle is able to stop in time or stay safely in course through \\na corner. The performance of a tire is therefore directly related to \\nthe braking behavior. \\n› In addition, our ContiTech group sector develops and supplies nu-\\nmerous sealing and suspension components for hydraulic, pneu-\\nmatic and electronic brake systems. Since they are used in a \\nsafety-relevant system, they are essential for the functional relia-\\nbility of a vehicle. \\nThe handling and adaptation of the respective portfolio is steered \\nby the responsible business. Oversight of the effectiveness of the \\nportfolio management is exercised by the group sector boards and \\nthe Executive Board, for example, in the strategy process. Manage-\\nment of the key processes is handled by the respective depart-\\nments within business, e.g. research and development (R&D), prod-\\nuct design, supply chain management and purchasing, and is sup-\\nported by the sustainability departments.  \\nThe processes for managing the opportunities of safe mobility \\nwithin Continental’s group sectors are especially R&D activities, \\nclose dialogue with customers, active portfolio management and \\nmarket observation. The development and placement of new prod-\\nucts for safe mobility are driven by increasing safety regulations, \\ne.g. US federal motor vehicle safety standards or the safety regula-\\ntions of the European Commission. Beside ensuring compliance \\nwith the constantly increasing regulations, Continental also re-\\nsearches and develops new products and solutions for safe mobil-\\nity. The product development processes also include working on \\nthe economic feasibility, market readiness and scaling of such solu-\\ntions as well as the cooperation with customers, suppliers and \\nother institutions (e.g. universities).  \\nElements of the management approach are codified in correspond-\\ning internal rules and frameworks. \\nThe management approach to safe mobility does not directly fol-\\nlow external standards. However, it is closely linked to the manage-\\nment approach to technical and product compliance.  \\nThe relevant impacts on end-users and consumers in the context \\nof safe mobility (especially personal safety) are not directly related \\nto their human rights, as they are positive impacts. \\n', \" \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n203\\nConsequently, Continental does not engage with consumers or \\nend-users on human rights. \\nAccordingly, the management approach is not based on interna-\\ntionally recognized human rights standards. \\nNevertheless, Continental’s whistleblowing channels such as the in-\\ntegrity hotline are open to consumers and end-users as well. \\nThe interests of consumers and end-users are the key drivers for \\nthe management approach. Their wishes and concerns regarding \\npersonal safety, reliability of the vehicle, comfort and convenience \\nor cost efficiency are not only relevant for Continental but also for \\nContinental’s business partners. The engagement with consumers \\nand their representatives takes place through various formats in-\\ncluding regular surveys as well as trade fairs. Understanding these \\ninterests helps Continental to develop and to place products and \\nsystems that meet the needs and expectations of the consumers \\nand end-users.  \\nContinental actively communicates about safe mobility in various \\nformats, also in the style of public advocacy to improve safe mobil-\\nity (e.g. via social media). Internal engagement also includes a vari-\\nety of formats. \\n \\nProcesses for engaging with consumers and end-users about \\nimpacts \\nDue to Continental’s role as a supplier to other companies, direct \\nprocesses for engaging with consumers and end-users as well as \\ntheir representatives about actual and potential impacts are primar-\\nily established for tires replacement market. Continental uses \\nmainly customer service centers which take care on customers’ re-\\nquests regarding product or service issues. In addition, for any con-\\ncerns regarding integrity topics, Continental’s integrity hotline is \\navailable to consumers and end-users via our website, by tele-\\nphone or email. \\nContinental gains insights into the perspectives of consumers and \\nend-users on actual or potential concrete impacts by means of di-\\nrect feedback, for example through customer service centers. In ad-\\ndition, Continental also receives feedback from their business part-\\nners about their end-users. Consumers and end-users that are par-\\nticularly vulnerable to impacts or are marginalized (e.g. children) \\nare not a specific focus area when it comes to obtaining insights \\ninto the perspectives of consumers and end-users. \\nThe combination of direct and indirect engagement with consum-\\ners and end-users leads to an engagement at different stages of \\nthe product life cycle. While the interaction in the replacement mar-\\nket and the indirect interaction via customers takes place on a con-\\ntinuous basis, event and incident-based interaction is by nature ir-\\nregular. This engagement and consideration of the views of con-\\nsumers and end-users is described in the respective management \\napproaches, particularly related to technical and product compli-\\nance (e.g. with regard to responsibilities or monitoring of effective-\\nness), as it constitutes a relevant input for those management ap-\\nproaches, through – among others – the related legal requirements. \\n \\nProcesses to remediate negative impacts and channels for \\nconsumers and end-users to raise concerns  \\n \\nGrievance channels for consumers and end-users \\nContinental’s processes and channels to cooperate on remediation \\nof negative impacts on consumers and end-users, and also to raise \\nconcerns, are mainly the customer service centers of the group \\nsectors and as well as Continental’s integrity hotline. \\nThe customer service centers are specific channels for consumers \\nand end-users for any product-related issues. Furthermore, the in-\\ntegrity hotline is an additional channel for integrity-related product \\nissues. However, it is not intended as a channel to report discontent \\nwith Continental’s products.  \\nThe availability of Continental's integrity hotline is pointed out in \\nContinental`s business relationships via our Business Partner Code \\nof Conduct, which is also publicly available on our website. \\nThe tracking and monitoring of concerns raised through customer \\nservice centers takes place directly in the customer service centers \\nand through related processes. The tracking and monitoring of the \\nintegrity-related product issues raised and dealt with was described \\nin the process for tC case management which is part of the man-\\nagement approach to technical and product compliance. Further \\ninformation on how Continental ensures the effectiveness of the in-\\ntegrity hotline can be found in the Business conduct and corporate \\ngovernance (ESRS G1) section in this sustainability report. \\nContinental does not explicitly assess the affected consumers’ and \\nend-users’ knowledge of these channels and their trust in them.  \\nFurther information on protection of Continental’s integrity hotline \\nusers from retaliation can be found in the information on Business \\nconduct and corporate governance (ESRS G1) in this sustainability \\nreport. \\nRemediation processes \\nContinental’s general approach to remedy in cases of material neg-\\native impacts on consumers and/or end-users is in line with na-\\ntional regulations.  \\nIn case of individual negative product-related incidents, Continental \\nfollows the regulations of the respective national authorities and ini-\\ntiates, if required, e.g. recalls either on its own or indirectly via re-\\ncalls by customers that place the final product on the market. This \\nmay also include remedial measures for consumers or end-users. \\nThe effectiveness of the measures is assessed as part of the de-\\nscribed management approach to technical and product-related \\ncompliance. \\n \\n\", ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \\n204\\nTargets Related to Consumers and End-Users \\nContinental has defined a systematic process for setting targets. \\nWith regard to consumers and end-users, it was decided to pursue \\nthe described management approaches and not to set a time-\\nbound sustainability target. The monitoring of effectiveness and \\nthe tracking of progress are described in the related management \\napproaches and the reported metrics. \\nKey Actions for Target Achievement \\nIn Continental’s view, key actions to be reported relate directly to \\ncorresponding targets, where available. Therefore, in accordance \\nwith this definition, Continental has not defined any key actions in \\nrelation to consumers and end-users beyond the described man-\\nagement approaches. \\nMetrics Related to Consumers and End-Users \\nCoverage of quality management systems \\n2024 \\nQuality management system certifications (ISO 9001 or similar)  \\nEmployee coverage (as at December 31), in % \\n85 \\n \\n \\nDefinitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: \\n- Included are own employees of the Continental Group with a valid and active \\nemployment contract as well as non-employees as at December 31, 2024.

The general disclosures in-\\nclude an overview of the assessment of all identified impacts, risks \\nand opportunities (IROs), including the time horizons considered. \\nIn this IRO assessment, the following material potential negative im-\\npacts and risks were identified in relation to business conduct and \\ncorporate governance. They have been grouped together into IRO \\nclusters for easier understanding and reading. The descriptions of \\nthe negative impacts and risks are presented from a gross perspec-\\ntive which, on the basis of the applied methodology, does not take \\ninto account mitigation through the management approaches of \\nContinental as described in the respective IRO cluster.

To a large \\nextent, the management approach is influenced by the attitude and \\nbehavior of Continental’s management and its handling of compli-\\nance risks. To cover all aspects in this regard, Continental has intro-\\nduced a comprehensive compliance management system (CMS), \\nwhich is steered and monitored by the compliance organization. \\nContinental’s compliance management system focuses on the fol-\\nlowing areas: \\n› Business ethics: Compliance with anti-corruption and anti-brib-\\nery laws in order to ensure ethical behavior when dealing with \\nbusiness partners and public officials as well as to promote ethi-\\ncal behavior. \\n› Antitrust: Compliance with the competition laws in force in order \\nto ensure free and fair competition. \\n› Anti-money laundering: Compliance with the applicable laws \\nand regulations with regard to anti-money laundering and coun-\\ntering the financing of terrorism. \\n› Data compliance: Compliance with all applicable international \\nand national data protection regulations for personal and non-\\npersonal data. \\nContinental’s compliance management system covers the entire \\nGroup and thus all entities under management control of Conti-\\nnental. \\nIn the first line (ref. to the Three Lines Model by The Institute of In-\\nternal Auditors), the accountability for the implementation of com-\\npliance lies with the management of the respective legal entities of \\nContinental and with all employees. The accountability for the sys-\\ntem’s governance framework lies with the Chief Compliance Officer \\n(CCO), who is appointed by the Executive Board and acts as the \\nsecond line. The CCO operates a compliance organization with sev-\\neral departments that report directly to the CCO. It consists of dedi-\\ncated specialized departments as well as of regional compliance \\ndepartments that primarily provide advice to the group sectors and \\nbusiness areas of the Group. An internal network of compliance co-\\nordinators in the countries where Continental has points of pres-\\nence supports the compliance department with dissemination of \\ninformation. The compliance coordinators also support central ac-\\ntivities and at the same time provide information on relevant local \\nregulations and requirements. The third line is represented by \\nGroup Internal Audit, which assesses the adequacy and effective-\\nness of the compliance management system in an independent \\nmanner. The Executive Board bears the overall responsibility for \\ncompliance and exercises oversight on the compliance manage-\\nment system. \\nInternal compliance controls, which are aligned with the respective \\nlegal entity’s risk profile, are implemented locally and aligned with \\nContinental’s GRC system, in particular with the Group-wide internal \\ncontrol process, which includes a dedicated methodology. \\nIn addition to the responsibilities within the organization, the Super-\\nvisory Board exercises further oversight over the company’s com-\\npliance management.  \\nAll members of the Executive Board of Continental have sufficient \\nexpertise with regard to business conduct and corporate govern-\\nance. Within the Executive Board, the Executive Board member for \\nGroup Finance and Controlling, Integrity and Law is responsible for \\ngovernance related to business conduct and corporate govern-\\nance. This Executive Board member therefore has special expertise. \\nFurther information on the expertise of the members of the Execu-\\ntive Board is disclosed in Annex to the By-Law of the Executive \\nBoard as well as in the curricula vitae of the individual Executive \\nBoard members on our website under Company / Corporate Gov-\\nernance / Executive Board. \\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board has strong and long-standing ex-\\npertise in the area of business conduct and corporate governance. \\nFurther information on the expertise of the individual Supervisory \\nBoard members can be found in the qualification matrix in the Cor-\\nporate governance statement in this annual report. \\nIn order to continuously ensure adequate design and operational \\neffectiveness of the CMS, various risk-based processes are carried \\nout by the compliance organization – both centrally and locally for \\nthe legal entities.  \\nIn cooperation with the relevant legal entities identified on the basis \\nof an internal initial risk assessment, the compliance organization \\nregularly carries out a risk identification and assessment process in \\norder to review individual risks of the respective legal entities.  \\nThe compliance organization regularly reviews its rules to ensure \\ncompliance with legal regulations and consistency with other inter-\\nnal rules. \\nThe compliance organization performs regular spot checks on lo-\\ncally implemented internal compliance controls and initiates reme-\\ndial measures in the event of deviations.  \\nIn addition, Group Internal Audit conducts focus audits of Conti-\\nnental’s compliance management system and considers compli-\\nance risks in its general audits at its own discretion. Furthermore, \\nthe compliance organization reviews the CMS processes in order to \\nidentify, analyze and eliminate any risks and inefficiencies of the \\nsystem.  \\nThe processes of the compliance management system support the \\nbusiness regarding compliant behavior of Continental's employees \\nin business processes. \\n\", \" \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Governance Information \\n207\\nFunctions of Continental that are most at risk with respect to cor-\\nruption and bribery are typically departments with third-party con-\\ntacts such as purchasing, sales, human relations, finance, and pub-\\nlic affairs. \\nAn important part of Continental’s compliance program is the op-\\nportunity for whistleblowers to report their concerns and griev-\\nances. A whistleblower can be any stakeholder of Continental, e.g. \\nan employee in Continental’s own workforce, a worker in the value \\nchain, a member of an affected community, a consumer or an end-\\nuser. The whistleblowing process is managed by means of a dedi-\\ncated internal rule that – in an end-to-end process – defines the \\nroles and responsibilities along the process steps of reporting, re-\\nport processing and substantiation, investigation and sanctioning, \\nall in line with the German Whistleblower Protection Act and perti-\\nnent international legislation.  \\nThis rule on whistleblowing also defines a process for reception of \\n(potential) compliance cases, their prompt, independent and objec-\\ntive processing, review and investigation and introduction of \\nmeasures, especially regarding: \\n› Manipulation of (financial) accounting, \\n› Competition/antitrust law, \\n› Fair and ethical conduct, conflicts of interest, \\n› Corruption/bribery, \\n› Discrimination, harassment, psychological violence, \\n› Environmental rights, \\n› Export and import control, including sanctions, \\n› Human rights, \\n› Information and trade secret protection, \\n› Integrity of the whistleblower system, such as whistleblower  \\nretaliation, or violation of confidentiality or the duty to report, \\n› Information technology (IT) security/cybercrime, \\n› Labor rights, including individual and collective rights, \\n› Market manipulation, including insider trading, \\n› Misuse of company property or services, and theft, \\n› Money laundering and financing of terrorism, \\n› Protection of personal data, \\n› Physical violence, \\n› Sabotage and vandalism, \\n› Terrorism, extremism and organized crime, \\n› Occupational safety and health, \\n› Sexual harassment, \\n› Tax evasion and tax fraud, \\n› Technical compliance (product compliance), \\n› (Digital) fraud, embezzlement and other forms of enrichment. \\nContinental provides whistleblowers with three whistleblowing \\nchannels: An integrity hotline with international and local phone \\nnumbers, an integrity platform (online form) as well as an integrity \\nemail address. These channels offer possibilities for confidential \\nand anonymous reporting of (potential) compliance cases. \\nThese cases are reviewed by a dedicated team of case managers \\nwithin the compliance organization who forward the cases to the \\ninternal audit departments for investigation if a report can be sub-\\nstantiated. Further information regarding the single steps of the \\nprocess can be found further below in the subsection Prevention \\nand detection of corruption and bribery. \\nThe underlying process is as well defined in an internal rule and \\nalso publicly available in the form of a condensed and accessible \\ndocument named Rules of Procedure. In addition, fixed employees \\nare offered a mandatory web-based basic training on the subject of \\nwhistleblowing. Moreover, the possibilities for whistleblowing are \\nregularly communicated to the employees, e. g. through special \\nposters that are hung up in Continental’s locations. \\nIn compliance with the Directive (EU) 2019/1937, Continental's \\nCode of Conduct as well as the dedicated internal rule on whistle-\\nblowing define non-tolerance of retaliation of whistleblowers and \\npenalize such behavior. Retaliation of whistleblowers, such as dis-\\nmissal, blacklisting, demoting, denying overtime or promotions, dis-\\nciplining, denying benefits, failing to (re)hire, and intimidation is seri-\\nous offense and is treated as such. \\nEmployees are free to report incidents of (potential) misconduct \\nalso to their superiors, human relation departments and other func-\\ntions. However, these people or functions are not reporting chan-\\nnels as per the German Whistleblower Protection Act. Therefore \\nconfidentiality, anonymity, and non-retaliation etc. cannot be fully \\nensured. \\nTo promote and further develop the corporate culture, the desired \\nconduct of employees and the self-image of the Continental Group, \\nContinental has developed a clear vision and mission as well as \\nfour fundamental corporate values, which form the roots of our cor-\\nporate culture. Furthermore, two internal principles contribute to \\nour corporate culture: our sustainability ambition and the binding \\nCode of Conduct for all employees of Continental. \\nTo assess its corporate culture, Continental has developed the OUR \\nBASICS Live Sustainable Engagement index as well as the OUR BA-\\nSICS Live Integrity Perception index which evaluate the perceived \\nstate of compliance culture. Both indices are calculated on the ba-\\nsis of the annual OUR BASICS Live Employee Survey (further infor-\\nmation can be found in the Own workforce (ESRS S1) section of \\nthis sustainability report). \\n\", \" \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Governance Information \\n208\\nContinental’s compliance management system is based on a set of \\nrules. As a main element of Continental’s compliance program, the \\ncreation and communication of rules is embedded into Conti-\\nnental’s rule governance process, utilizing a centrally-used rule \\nmanagement application including relevant processes.  \\nContinental's compliance management system is based on the IDW \\nAssurance Standard 980 for compliance management systems of \\nthe Institute of Public Auditors in Germany, Incorporated Associa-\\ntion (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e. V. (IDW)). \\nContinental’s management approach with regard to business con-\\nduct, corporate governance and corporate culture considers the in-\\nterests of various stakeholders such as employees, shareholders, \\ncustomers and whistleblowers. \\nThe communication of CMS-relevant information is managed by \\nthe compliance organization promoting integrity culture in general \\nas well as compliance areas and topics in particular. For example, a \\nregular series called “Case of the Quarter” enhances sensitivity to \\ncompliance topics through an accessible and easy-to-understand \\n“true crime” format. Open calls, intranet articles, workshops, and \\nposts in relevant internal channels focus on topics at hand. Addi-\\ntionally, the compliance management system comprises several \\nmandatory general as well as specific web-based and face-to-face \\ntraining sessions for various target groups in the respective group \\nsectors or functions. \\nA comprehensive training concept ensures basic training for \\nContinental’s fixed employees in the mentioned compliance areas \\nas well as risk-based advanced and deep dive training for topic- \\nand target group-specific content. The training plan foresees basic \\ntraining courses for anti-bribery and anti-corruption topics. These \\nare held annually and are mandatory for all fixed employees. See \\nalso the associated metric “Anti-corruption and anti-bribery train-\\ning programs”. \\n \\nPrevention and detection of corruption and bribery \\nContinental has established its integrity hotline as the main system \\nto report, prevent and detect unethical and unlawful behavior, in-\\ncluding corruption and bribery. The reporting of such concerns \\nmakes an important contribution towards detection and prevention \\nof misconduct. Continental does not tolerate retaliation against \\nwhistleblowers.  \\nThe procedures in place to prevent, detect and deal with allega-\\ntions or incidents of corruption and bribery are covered by the de-\\nscribed management approaches to business conduct, corporate \\ngovernance and corporate culture. \\nIn the event of report placement, an independent investigation unit \\nfrom the internal audit function decides on conducting of the inves-\\ntigation within the limitations of an internal rule for whistleblowing \\nand internal investigations at its own discretion.  \\nAll investigations are subject to the need-to-know principle. Accord-\\ning to this principle, information may only be distributed or made \\naccessible to persons who receive allegations, administer cases, \\nperform investigations, define sanctions, or support any of these \\nactivities, or where Continental has a legitimate interest to inform \\nother departments (for example, in cases of litigation), where re-\\nquired. Particularly, the identities of the whistleblower and the ac-\\ncused person remain confidential and undisclosed to unconcerned \\nparties, unless the investigation, conflicting (data protection) laws \\nand regulations, and/or legal proceedings require doing so. \\nFor each case investigated, the investigation unit prepares a report \\nand evaluates the case at its own discretion. After finalization of a \\ndraft report, the investigation unit sends the report to the compli-\\nance case management team (as part of the Compliance organiza-\\ntion) for review and quality assurance. The recommendations con-\\ntained in the report are defined and tracked by the respective in-\\nvestigation unit and are implemented by the management. \\nThe compliance case management team submits a report about \\nongoing and closed investigations to the Chief Compliance Officer \\nand the Head of Group Internal Audit on a quarterly basis. In cases \\nof assumed high impact for Continental in the short term, the com-\\npliance case management team immediately reports the circum-\\nstances of the respective case to the Chief Compliance Officer. \\nThe Chief Compliance Officer and the Head of Group Internal Audit \\nreport to the Executive Board as well as to the Audit Committee of \\nthe Supervisory Board on a regular basis. If an allegation against a \\nmember of the Executive Board is substantiated, the report is not \\nforwarded to the Executive Board but to the Chairman of the Audit \\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board. \\nIn general, communication about corruption and bribery matters is \\npart of the overarching management approach to business con-\\nduct, corporate governance and corporate culture. In addition, all \\ninternal rules are available on Continental’s platform for internal \\nrules on the intranet and is accessible to every employee with com-\\nputer access. Web-based and face-to-face trainings ensure that rule \\ncontent is explained to addressees in practical terms including \\nproviding examples and case studies. \\nContinental’s anti-corruption and anti-bribery training program are \\nmainly drawn up on web-based training courses delivered via a \\nspecial learning platform. Basic principles and rules on this topic \\nare presented and case studies are provided so that participants \\nthemselves can check the correct understanding of the learning \\ncontent. The training is mandatory for all fixed employees. Through \\nface-to-face training focusing on specialized in-depth content, se-\\nlected functions (e.g. purchasing and sales) are trained in relevant \\naspects of business conduct and corporate governance. \\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are regularly up-\\ndated by the Chief Compliance Officer on recent developments re-\\ngarding compliance (anti-corruption and anti-bribery) topics. These \\nupdates contain updates on new regulatory requirements, if re-\\nquired, and therefore serve a training purpose. In addition, the Ex-\\necutive Board receives the same compliance training as all other \\nfixed employees. \\n\", ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Governance Information \\n209\\nTargets Related to Business Conduct and Corporate Governance \\nContinental has defined a systematic process for setting targets. \\nWith regard to business conduct and corporate governance, it was \\ndecided to pursue the management approaches described and not \\nto set a time-bound sustainability target.

Auditor on a Limited Assurance \\nEngagement in Relation to the Group Sustainability Report \\nTo Continental Aktiengesellschaft, Hanover \\nAssurance conclusion \\nWe have conducted a limited assurance engagement on the group \\nsustainability report of Continental Aktiengesellschaft, Hanover, \\n(hereinafter the “Company”) included in section “Sustainability Re-\\nport” of the group management report, which is combined with the \\nCompany's management report, for the financial year from 1 Janu-\\nary to 31 December 2024 (hereinafter the “Group Sustainability \\nReport”). The Group Sustainability Report has been prepared to ful-\\nfil the requirements of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European \\nParliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 (Corporate \\nSustainability Reporting Directive, CSRD) and Article 8 of Regula-\\ntion (EU) 2020/852 as well as §§ [Articles] 289b to 289e HGB \\n[Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and §§ 315b to \\n315c HGB to prepare a combined non-financial statement. \\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, \\nnothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that \\nthe accompanying Group Sustainability Report is not prepared, in \\nall material respects, in accordance with the requirements of the \\nCSRD and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, § 315c in con-\\njunction with §§ 289c to 289e HGB to prepare a combined non- \\nfinancial statement as well as with the supplementary criteria pre-\\nsented by the executive directors of the Company. This assurance \\nconclusion includes that no matters have come to our attention \\nthat cause us to believe: \\n› that the accompanying Group Sustainability Report does not \\ncomply, in all material respects, with the European Sustainability \\nReporting Standards (ESRS), including that the process carried \\nout by the Company to identify the information to be included in \\nthe Group Sustainability Report (hereinafter the “materiality as-\\nsessment”) is not, in all material respects, in accordance with the \\ndescription set out in section “Process to identify and assess  \\nmaterial impacts, risks, and opportunities (acc. to ESRS 2 IRO-1)” of \\nthe Group Sustainability Report, or \\n› that the disclosures set out in section “Information in Accordance \\nwith the EU Taxonomy Regulation” of the Group Sustainability  \\nReport do not comply, in all material respects, with Article 8 of \\nRegulation (EU) 2020/852. \\nBasis for the assurance conclusion \\nWe conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance \\nwith the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) \\n3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Re-\\nviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International \\nAuditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). \\nThe procedures in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature \\nand timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assur-\\nance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained is \\nsubstantially lower than the assurance that would have been ob-\\ntained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. \\nOur responsibilities under ISAE 3000 (Revised) are further de-\\nscribed in the “German public auditor's responsibilities for the as-\\nsurance engagement on the Group Sustainability Report” section. \\nWe are independent of the Company in accordance with the re-\\nquirements of European law and German commercial and profes-\\nsional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional re-\\nsponsibilities in accordance with these requirements. Our audit firm \\nhas complied with the quality management system requirements \\nof the IDW Standard on Quality Management: Requirements for \\nQuality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)) is-\\nsued by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Audi-\\ntors in Germany; IDW). We believe that the evidence we have ob-\\ntained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assur-\\nance conclusion. \\nResponsibility of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory \\nBoard for the Group Sustainability Report \\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the \\nGroup Sustainability Report in accordance with the requirements of \\nthe CSRD and the relevant German legal and other European regu-\\nlations as well as with the supplementary criteria presented by the \\nexecutive directors of the Company. They are also responsible for \\nthe design, implementation and maintenance of such internal con-\\ntrols that they have considered necessary to enable the prepara-\\ntion of a Group Sustainability Report in accordance with these reg-\\nulations that is free from material misstatement, whether due to \\nfraud (i.e., manipulation of the Group Sustainability Report) or error. \\nThis responsibility of the executive directors includes establishing \\nand maintaining the materiality assessment process, selecting and \\napplying appropriate reporting policies for preparing the Group \\nSustainability Report, as well as making assumptions and estimates \\nand ascertaining forward-looking information for individual sustain-\\nability-related disclosures. \\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for \\nthe preparation of the Group Sustainability Report. \\nIndependent Auditor's Report on the \\nSustainability Report \\n\", \" \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Independent Auditor's Report on the Sustainability Report \\n221\\nInherent limitations in the preparation of the Group \\nSustainability Report \\nThe CSRD and the relevant German statutory and other European \\nregulations contain wording and terms that are still subject to con-\\nsiderable interpretation uncertainties and for which no authorita-\\ntive, comprehensive interpretations have yet been published. There-\\nfore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretations of \\nsuch wording and terms in sections “General Disclosures” and \\n“Disclosures in Accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation” of \\nthe Group Sustainability Report. The executive directors are respon-\\nsible for the defensibility of these interpretations. As such wording \\nand terms may be interpreted differently by regulators or courts, \\nthe legal conformity of measurements or evaluations of sustain-\\nability matters based on these interpretations is uncertain. \\nThese inherent limitations also affect the assurance engagement \\non the Group Sustainability Report. \\nGerman public auditor's responsibilities for the assurance \\nengagement on the Group Sustainability Report \\nOur objective is to express a limited assurance conclusion, based \\non the assurance engagement we have conducted, on whether any \\nmatters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that \\nthe Group Sustainability Report has not been prepared, in all mate-\\nrial respects, in accordance with the CSRD and the relevant Ger-\\nman legal and other European regulations as well as with the sup-\\nplementary criteria presented by the executive directors of the \\nCompany, and to issue an assurance report that includes our assur-\\nance conclusion on the Group Sustainability Report. \\nAs part of a limited assurance engagement in accordance with \\nISAE 3000 (Revised), we exercise professional judgment and main-\\ntain professional skepticism. We also:  \\n› obtain an understanding of the process to prepare the Group Sus-\\ntainability Report, including the materiality assessment process \\ncarried out by the Company to identify the information to be in-\\ncluded in the Group Sustainability Report. \\n› identify disclosures where a material misstatement due to fraud \\nor error is likely to arise, design and perform procedures to ad-\\ndress these disclosures and obtain limited assurance to support \\nthe assurance conclusion. The risk of not detecting a material \\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not \\ndetecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud \\nmay involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misleading \\nrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. In addition, \\nthe risk of not detecting a material misstatement within value \\nchain information from sources not under the control of the com-\\npany (value chain information) is generally higher than the risk of \\nnot detecting a material misstatement of value chain information \\nfrom sources under the control of the company, as both the exec-\\nutive directors of the Company and we, as assurance practition-\\ners, are ordinarily subject to limitations on direct access to the \\nsources of value chain information. \\n› consider the forward-looking information, including the appropri-\\nateness of the underlying assumptions. There is a substantial una-\\nvoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the for-\\nward-looking information. \\nSummary of the procedures performed by the German public \\nauditor \\nA limited assurance engagement involves the performance of pro-\\ncedures to obtain evidence about the sustainability information. \\nThe nature, timing and extent of the selected procedures are sub-\\nject to our professional judgement. \\nIn conducting our limited assurance engagement, we have, \\namongst other things: \\n› evaluated the suitability of the criteria as a whole presented by \\nthe executive directors in the Group Sustainability Report. \\n› inquired of the executive directors and relevant employees in-\\nvolved in the preparation of the Group Sustainability Report \\nabout the preparation process, including the materiality assess-\\nment process carried out by the company to identify the infor-\\nmation to be included in the Group Sustainability Report, and \\nabout the internal controls relating to this process. \\n› evaluated the reporting policies used by the executive directors \\nto prepare the Group Sustainability Report. \\n› evaluated the reasonableness of the estimates and the related \\ndisclosures provided by the executive directors. If, in accordance \\nwith the ESRS, the executive directors estimate the value chain in-\\nformation to be reported for a case in which the executive direc-\\ntors are unable to obtain the information from the value chain de-\\nspite making reasonable efforts, our assurance engagement is \\nlimited to evaluating whether the executive directors have under-\\ntaken these estimates in accordance with the ESRS and assessing \\nthe reasonableness of these estimates, but does not include iden-\\ntifying information in the value chain that the executive directors \\nhave been unable to obtain. \\n› performed analytical procedures and made inquiries in relation to \\nselected information in the Group Sustainability Report. \\n› performed site visits. \\n› considered the presentation of the information in the Group Sus-\\ntainability Report. \\n› considered the process for identifying taxonomy-eligible and tax-\\nonomy-aligned economic activities and the corresponding disclo-\\nsures in the Group Sustainability Report. \\n\", \" \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Independent Auditor's Report on the Sustainability Report \\n222\\nRestriction of use \\nWe draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was \\nconducted for the Company’s purposes and that the report is in-\\ntended solely to inform the Company about the result of the assur-\\nance engagement. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be \\nused by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it. \\nOur responsibility is solely towards the Company.

The consolidated financial statements were prepared \\nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) \\nas adopted by the EU, and include any necessary and appropriate \\nestimates. The management report for Continental AG and the \\nContinental Group contains an analysis of the earnings, financial \\nand net assets position of the Continental Group, as well as further \\ninformation provided in accordance with the provisions of the Ger-\\nman Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB). \\nAn effective internal management and control system is employed \\nto ensure that the information used for the preparation of the con-\\nsolidated financial statements, including the management report \\nfor Continental AG and the Continental Group, as well as for internal \\nreporting, is reliable. This includes standardized guidelines at the \\ncorporate level for accounting and risk management in accordance \\nwith Section 91 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktien-\\ngesetz – AktG) and an integrated financial control system as part of \\nthe Continental Group’s value-oriented management, plus audits by \\nGroup Audit. The Executive Board is thus in a position to identify \\nsignificant risks at an early stage and to take countermeasures. \\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH, Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, \\nHanover branch, Germany, was engaged as the auditor for fiscal \\n2024 by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of Continental AG. The \\naudit mandate was issued by the Audit Committee of the Super-\\nvisory Board.

These documents relating \\nto the annual financial statements and these reports will then be \\ndiscussed with the entire Supervisory Board, also in the presence \\nof the auditor, at the meeting of the Supervisory Board held to  \\napprove the financial statements. \\nHanover, February 26, 2025 \\nThe Executive Board \\n \\nStatement of the Executive Board \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Independent Auditor’s Report \\n225\\nTo Continental Aktiengesellschaft, Hanover \\nReport on the Audit of the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements and of the \\nConsolidated Management Report \\nAudit opinions \\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Continen-\\ntal Aktiengesellschaft, Hanover, and its subsidiaries (the Group), \\nwhich comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as \\nat December 31, 2024, consolidated statement of comprehensive \\nincome, consolidated statement of income, consolidated statement \\nof changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for \\nthe financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2024, and the \\nnotes to the consolidated financial statements, including material ac-\\ncounting policy information. In addition, we have audited the consol-\\nidated management report of Continental Aktiengesellschaft, which \\nis combined with the Company’s management report, for the finan-\\ncial year from January 1 to December 31, 2024. In accordance with \\nGerman legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the \\nparts of the consolidated management report specified in the “Other \\ninformation” section of our auditor’s report. \\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,  \\n› the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in \\nall material respects, with the requirements of the International \\nAccounting Standards Board (hereinafter “IFRS Accounting Stand-\\nards”) as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of \\nGerman commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the Ger-\\nman Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB and, in compli-\\nance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the as-\\nsets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at December \\n31, 2024, and of its financial performance for the financial year \\nfrom January 1 to December 31, 2024, and \\n› the accompanying consolidated management report as a whole \\nprovides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all mate-\\nrial respects, this consolidated management report is consistent \\nwith the consolidated financial statements, complies with German \\nlegal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities \\nand risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the consoli-\\ndated management report does not cover the content of the \\nparts of the consolidated management report specified in the \\n“Other information” section.  \\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our \\naudit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compli-\\nance of the consolidated financial statements and of the consoli-\\ndated management report. \\nBasis for the audit opinions \\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements \\nand of the consolidated management report in accordance with \\nSection 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, re-\\nferred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) in compliance with \\nGerman Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Au-\\ndits promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (In-\\nstitut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW). Our responsibilities under those \\nrequirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s \\nresponsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial state-\\nments and of the consolidated management report” section of our \\nauditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in ac-\\ncordance with the requirements of European law and German com-\\nmercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other Ger-\\nman professional responsibilities in accordance with these require-\\nments. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) (f) of the EU \\nAudit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit \\nservices prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. \\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient \\nand appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the \\nconsolidated financial statements and on the consolidated man-\\nagement report. \\nKey audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial \\nstatements \\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judg-\\nment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated  \\nfinancial statements for the financial year from January 1 to De-\\ncember 31, 2024. These matters were addressed in the context  \\nof our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole \\nand in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a  \\nseparate audit opinion on these matters. \\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as \\nfollows: \\n› Recoverability of goodwill and non-current assets with finite use-\\nful lives \\n› Accounting treatment of deferred taxes \\n \\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in \\neach case as follows: \\n› Matter and issue  \\n› Audit approach and findings \\n› Reference to further information \\n \\nIndependent Auditor’s Report \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Independent Auditor’s Report \\n 226\\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters: \\nRecoverability of goodwill and non-current assets with finite \\nuseful lives \\n› Goodwill amounting in total to €3,164.5 million (8.6% of total as-\\nsets or 21.4% of total equity) and non-current assets with finite \\nuseful lives amounting in total to €12,371.4 million (33.5% of to-\\ntal assets or 83.6% of total equity) are reported in the Company’s \\nconsolidated financial statements. While goodwill must be tested \\nfor impairment once a year or when there are indications of im-\\npairment, non-current assets with finite useful lives only have to \\nbe tested for impairment if there are indications that they may be \\nimpaired (triggering events). The impairment test is performed at \\nthe level of the cash-generating units. The carrying amount of the \\nrelevant cash-generating units (where applicable including good-\\nwill) is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in \\nthe context of the impairment test. The recoverable amount is the \\nhigher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The \\nCompany generally determines the recoverable amount using \\nthe value in use. The present value of the future cash flows from \\nthe respective cash-generating units normally serves as the basis \\nof valuation. Present values are calculated using discounted cash \\nflow models. For this purpose, the long-term planning for the \\ncash-generating units adopted by the executive directors forms \\nthe starting point which is extrapolated based on assumptions \\nabout long-term rates of growth. Expectations relating to future \\nmarket developments and assumptions about the development \\nof macroeconomic factors, which are currently subject to in-\\ncreased uncertainties, are also taken into account. The discount \\nrate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the respec-\\ntive cash-generating unit. If the value in use falls below the carry-\\ning amount of the cash-generating unit, it is assessed whether the \\nfair values less costs of disposal of the assets exceed their carry-\\ning amounts. If not, the need for write-downs shall be based on \\nthe higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. The \\nimpairment test determined that no write-downs were necessary. \\nThe outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on \\nthe estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the \\nfuture cash flows from the respective cash-generating units, the \\ndiscount rate used, the rate of growth and other assumptions, \\nand is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this \\nbackground and due to the complex nature of the valuation, this \\nmatter was of particular significance in the context of our audit. \\n› As part of our audit we assessed the methodology used for the \\npurposes of performing the impairment test, among other things, \\nwith the assistance of our internal specialists from Valuation, \\nModeling & Analytics. After matching the future cash inflows used \\nfor the calculation against the long-term planning for the cash-\\ngenerating units adopted by the executive directors, we assessed \\nthe appropriateness of the calculation, in particular by reconciling \\nit with general and sector-specific market expectations. In addi-\\ntion, we assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of \\ngroup functions. In the knowledge that even relatively small \\nchanges in the discount rate applied can have a material impact \\non the value of the entity calculated in this way, we focused our \\ntesting in particular on the parameters used to determine the dis-\\ncount rate applied, and assessed the calculation model. In order \\nto reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, we evalu-\\nated the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company on the \\neffect of potential changes in revenue, the discount rate and the \\nlong-term rate of growth on the recoverable amount. If the value \\nin use fell below the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit, \\nwe assessed whether the fair values less costs of disposal of the \\nassets still correctly covered their carrying amounts. \\n› In addition, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes re-\\nlating to the recoverability of goodwill were appropriate and com-\\nplete.  \\n› Overall, the valuation parameters and assumptions used by the \\nexecutive directors are in line with our expectations and are also \\nwithin the ranges considered by us to be reasonable. \\n› The Company’s disclosures on goodwill and on non-current as-\\nsets with finite useful lives are contained in Notes 2, 13 and 14 of \\nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements. \\nAccounting treatment of deferred taxes  \\n› Deferred tax assets amounting to €2,523.4 million (6.8% of total \\nassets or 17.1% of total equity) after netting are reported in the \\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements, of which €453.6 \\nmillion relates to tax loss carryforwards. Before netting with \\nmatching deferred tax liabilities, deferred tax assets amounted to \\n€3,844.0 million. These items were recognized to the extent that \\nthe executive directors consider it probable that taxable profit will \\nbe available in the foreseeable future which will enable the de-\\nductible temporary differences and unused tax losses to be uti-\\nlized. For this purpose, insofar as sufficient deferred tax liabilities \\nare not available, future taxable profits are projected on the basis \\nof the business plan adopted by the executive directors. No de-\\nferred tax assets were recognized in respect of deductible tempo-\\nrary differences, eligible tax credits and unused tax losses amount-\\ning in total to €4,387.3 million since it is not probable that they \\nwill be utilized for tax purposes by means of offset against taxable \\nprofits.  \\n› In our view, the accounting treatment of deferred taxes was of \\nparticular significance in the context of our audit, as it depends  \\nto a large extent on the estimates and assumptions made by the \\nexecutive directors and is therefore subject to uncertainties. \\nAs part of our audit of the recoverability of deferred tax assets \\nand with the assistance of our specialists from Tax Reporting & \\nStrategy, we assessed, among other things, the internal processes \\nand controls for recording tax matters as well as the methodol-\\nogy used for the determination, accounting treatment and meas-\\nurement of deferred taxes. We also assessed the recoverability  \\nof the deferred tax assets relating to deductible temporary differ-\\nences and unused tax losses on the basis of internal forecasts of \\nthe Company’s and its subsidiaries’ future earnings situation for \\ntax purposes, and the appropriateness of the underlying estimates \\nand assumptions. Based on our audit procedures, we were able to \\nsatisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the \\nexecutive directors are substantiated and sufficiently documented. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Independent Auditor’s Report \\n227\\n› The Company’s disclosures on deferred taxes are contained in \\nNotes 2 and 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial state-\\nments. \\nOther information \\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information.

In addition, the executive directors are \\nresponsible for such internal control as they have determined nec-\\nessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial state-\\nments that are free from material misstatement, whether due to \\nfraud (i.e. fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of  \\nassets) or error. \\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive  \\ndirectors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to con-\\ntinue as a going concern.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement \\nresulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as \\nfraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, mis-\\nrepresentations or the override of internal controls. \\n› Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit \\nof the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements \\nand measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the consolidated \\nmanagement report in order to design audit procedures that are \\nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of ex-\\npressing an audit opinion on the Group’s internal control or on \\nthe effectiveness of these systems. \\n› Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the \\nexecutive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by \\nthe executive directors and related disclosures. \\n› Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use \\nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the au-\\ndit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists re-\\nlated to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on \\nthe Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we con-\\nclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw \\nattention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the \\nconsolidated financial statements and in the consolidated man-\\nagement report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify \\nour respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the \\naudit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. \\nHowever, future events or conditions may cause the Group to \\ncease to be able to continue as a going concern. \\n› Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the \\nconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and \\nwhether the consolidated financial statements present the under-\\nlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated \\nfinancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabili-\\nties, financial position and financial performance of the Group in \\ncompliance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the \\nEU and the additional requirements of German commercial law \\npursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB. \\n› Plan and perform the audit of the consolidated financial state-\\nments to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding \\nthe financial information of the entities or sub-areas within the \\nGroup to serve as a basis for formulating audit opinions on the \\nconsolidated financial statements and on the consolidated man-\\nagement report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision \\nand review of the audit activities conducted for the purpose of \\nauditing the consolidated financial statements. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinions. \\n› Evaluate the consistency of the consolidated management report \\nwith the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with \\nGerman law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. \\n› Perform audit procedures on the prospective information pre-\\nsented by the executive directors in the consolidated manage-\\nment report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence \\nwe evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the \\nexecutive directors as a basis for the prospective information and \\nevaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information \\nfrom these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit \\nopinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions \\nused as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future \\nevents will differ materially from the prospective information. \\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, \\namong other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit \\nand significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies \\nin internal control that we identify during our audit. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Independent Auditor’s Report \\n229\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement \\nthat we have complied with the relevant independence require-\\nments, and communicate with them all relationships and other \\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independ-\\nence and, where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or \\nsafeguards applied. \\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with govern-\\nance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in \\nthe audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current pe-\\nriod and are therefore the key audit matters.

Segment Reporting\\nIn accordance with the provisions of IFRS 8, Operating Segments, \\nContinental AG’s segment reporting is based on the management \\napproach with regard to segment identification, under which infor-\\nmation regularly provided to the chief operating decision-maker for \\ndecision-making purposes is considered decisive. \\nThe activities of the Continental Group are divided into the following \\nsegments: \\nAutomotive offers technologies for safety, brake, chassis, motion \\nand motion-control systems. Its portfolio also includes innovative \\nsolutions for assisted and automated driving, display and operating \\ntechnologies, camera solutions for the vehicle interior as well as in-\\ntelligent information and communication technology associated \\nwith the mobility services of fleet operators and commercial vehi-\\ncle manufacturers. Comprehensive activities relating to vehicle con-\\nnectivity, architecture and electronics, as well as high-performance \\ncomputers and software solutions, round off the range of products \\nand services. \\nTires offers a premium portfolio of innovative tire solutions for the \\npassenger car, truck, bus, two-wheeler and specialty segment, as \\nwell as intelligent products and services related to tires and the pro-\\nmotion of sustainability. For specialist dealers and fleet managers, \\nTires provides digital tire monitoring and tire management systems, \\nin addition to other services, which keep fleets mobile and increase \\ntheir efficiency. With its tires, the segment contributes to safe, efficient \\nand environmentally friendly mobility.  \\nContiTech draws on its materials expertise to develop solutions for \\nindustrial applications made from rubber, metal and textiles. Its \\nbroad portfolio of hoses, conveyor belts, air springs and drive belts \\nis designed for the operating conditions in industrial environments, \\nwhich can be challenging. At the same time, ContiTech offers sur-\\nface materials with an appealing look and feel for home and vehicle \\ninteriors. ContiTech’s industrial growth areas are primarily in energy, \\nmining, agriculture and construction, as well as exterior and interior \\ndesign.  \\nThe contract manufacturing of products by Continental companies \\nfor the Schaeffler Group/Vitesco Technologies (until the merger on \\nOctober 1, 2024) is consolidated in Contract Manufacturing. This \\ncontract manufacturing is not intended to be a permanent situation; \\nrather, the operational separation of production will continue to be \\npromoted and the volume of contract manufacturing reduced. \\nThese segments correspond to the group sectors as defined in the \\nStructure of the Continental Group section of the consolidated \\nmanagement report. \\nOther/holding/consolidation \\nThis comprises centrally managed subsidiaries and affiliates, such \\nas holding, financing and insurance companies, as well as the hold-\\ning function of Continental AG and certain effects of consolidation. \\nIt also contains the effects on earnings of uncertain risks, \\nparticularly those in connection with contractual and similar claims \\nor obligations representing, among other things, risks from invest-\\nments that cannot currently be assigned to the individual operating \\nunits.  \\nInternal control and reporting within the Continental Group are \\nbased on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as  \\ndescribed in Note 2. The Continental Group measures the perfor-\\nmance of its segments on the basis of their adjusted operating re-\\nsult (adjusted EBIT). Their performance is expressed as the return \\non sales (adjusted EBIT divided by adjusted sales) and as the return \\non capital employed (ROCE), which represents EBIT as a percent-\\nage of average operating assets. Intersegment sales and other pro-\\nceeds are determined at arm’s length prices. For administrative ser-\\nvices performed by centrally operated companies or by the Conti-\\nnental Group’s management, costs are calculated on an arm’s \\nlength basis in line with utilization. Where direct allocation is not \\npossible, costs are assigned according to the services performed. \\nThe segment assets comprise the operating assets of the assets \\nside of the statement of financial position as at the end of the re-\\nporting period. The segment liabilities show the operating asset \\nparts on the liabilities side of the statement of financial position. \\nCapital expenditure relates to additions to property, plant and \\nequipment, and software, as well as additions to capitalized right-of-\\nuse assets in line with IFRS 16, Leases, and additions to capitalized \\nborrowing costs in line with IAS 23, Borrowing Costs. Depreciation \\nand amortization include the scheduled diminution of and the im-\\npairment on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, capi-\\ntalized right-of-use assets and investment properties as well as the \\nimpairment on goodwill. This figure does not include impairment \\non financial investments. \\nNon-cash expenses/income mainly include additions to and rever-\\nsals of pension and warranty provisions as well as provisions for  \\nlitigation and environmental risks. \\nIn the segment information broken down by country and region, \\nsales are allocated on the basis of the domicile of the respective \\ncustomers; in contrast, capital expenditure and segment assets are \\nallocated on the basis of the domicile of the respective companies. \\nViewed across all segments, Continental recorded sales totaling \\n€4,671 million (PY: €4,707 million) with a group of companies  \\nunder common control in the year under review. \\nIn 2024, the Continental Group generated 20% of its sales in the \\nUSA (PY: 21%), 20% in Germany (PY: 19%) and 11% in China (PY: \\n11%). Other than these countries, there were no countries in which \\nmore than 10% of sales were achieved, as was also the case in the \\nprevious year.  \\nA summary of research and development expenses by segment is \\nincluded in Note 7.  \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the

General Information and Accounting Principles \\nContinental Aktiengesellschaft (Continental AG), whose registered \\noffice is Continental-Plaza 1, Hanover, Germany, is the parent com-\\npany of the Continental Group and a listed stock corporation. It is \\nentered in the commercial register of the Hanover Local Court \\n(Amtsgericht) under HR B 3527. The Continental Group is a supplier \\nto the automotive industry, with worldwide operations. The areas of \\nbusiness and main activities in which the Continental Group is en-\\ngaged are described in more detail in the Segment Reporting sec-\\ntion. The consolidated financial statements of Continental AG for fis-\\ncal 2024 were prepared by resolution of the Executive Board of Feb-\\nruary 26, 2025, and will be submitted to and published in the Ger-\\nman Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger). Continental AG is included \\nin the consolidated financial statements of INA-Holding Schaeffler \\nGmbH & Co. KG, Herzogenaurach, Germany, which are published in \\nthe German Federal Gazette. \\nThe consolidated financial statements of Continental AG as at De-\\ncember 31, 2024, have been prepared in accordance with Interna-\\ntional Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the Euro-\\npean Union, pursuant to EU Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 in con-\\njunction with Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code \\n(Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB). The term IFRS also includes the Inter-\\nnational Accounting Standards (IAS), the interpretations issued by \\nthe International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations \\nCommittee (IFRS IC) or its predecessor the International Financial \\nReporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), and those of the for-\\nmer Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC). All International  \\nFinancial Reporting Standards mandatory for fiscal 2024 have \\nbeen applied, subject to endorsement by the European Union.  \\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the \\nbasis of historical cost, with the exception of certain financial assets \\nand liabilities (including derivative instruments), which are meas-\\nured at fair value; assets held for sale, which are measured at the \\nlower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell (or \\ncosts to distribute); and defined benefit pension plans, for which \\nthe plan assets are measured at fair value. \\nThe annual financial statements of companies included in the Conti-\\nnental Group have been prepared using uniform accounting policies, \\nin accordance with IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements. The \\nreporting date for the individual financial statements of companies \\nincluded in the Continental Group is the same as the reporting date \\nfor the consolidated financial statements. \\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros. \\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts are shown in millions of euros \\n(€ millions). Please note that differences may arise as a result of the \\nuse of rounded amounts and percentages. \\nCompanies consolidated \\nAll major subsidiaries that Continental AG controls in accordance \\nwith the provisions of IFRS 10 have been included in the consoli-\\ndated financial statements and are fully consolidated. To meet this \\ndefinition, Continental AG must have the decision-making power to \\ncontrol the relevant activities and a right to variable returns from \\nthe associated company. Furthermore, it must be able to use its  \\ndecision-making power to determine the amount of these returns. \\nThe companies consolidated may therefore also include companies \\nthat are controlled by Continental AG irrespective of the share of \\nvoting rights by way of other substantial rights such as contractual \\nagreements, as is the case with structured units included in the \\nconsolidated financial statements.  \\nThe consolidation of subsidiaries is based on the acquisition \\nmethod by offsetting the acquisition cost against the proportion of \\nnet assets attributed to the parent company at fair value at the ac-\\nquisition date. Intangible assets not previously recognized in the \\nseparate financial statements of the acquired company are carried \\nat fair value. Intangible assets identified in the course of a business \\ncombination – including, for example, brand names, patents, tech-\\nnology, customer relationships and order backlogs – are recognized \\nseparately at the acquisition date only if the requirements under \\nIAS 38, Intangible Assets, for an intangible asset are met. Measure-\\nment at the acquisition date is usually provisional only. Increases or \\nreductions of assets and liabilities that become necessary within \\n12 months after the acquisition are made retrospectively as at the \\nacquisition date. Significant adjustments are presented in the notes \\nto the financial statements. \\nAny positive remaining amount is capitalized as goodwill. The share \\nof non-controlling interests is measured using the share of (remeas-\\nured) net assets of the subsidiary. In order to ensure the recovera-\\nbility of goodwill arising from an as yet incomplete measurement \\nand the corresponding purchase price allocation, the goodwill is al-\\nlocated provisionally to the affected cash-generating units (CGUs) \\nas at the end of the reporting period. This provisional allocation can \\ndeviate significantly from the final allocation. Any negative differ-\\nence that arises is recognized in other income after the fair value  \\nof the acquired assets and liabilities has again been reviewed. \\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of subsidiaries that are \\nnot attributable to the Continental Group are shown under “Non-\\ncontrolling interests” as a separate component of total equity. \\nOnce control has been obtained, any differences arising from suc-\\ncessive purchases of shares from non-controlling interests between \\nthe purchase price and the carrying amount of those non-control-\\nling interests are recognized in other comprehensive income. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n246\\nWhere there are successive purchases of shares resulting in con-\\ntrol, the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value \\nat the time of first-time consolidation for those shares already held \\nis recognized in profit or loss under other income and expenses. \\nSignificant investments where Continental AG can exert significant \\ninfluence on the associated companies (associates) are accounted \\nfor using the equity method. The carrying amount of these associ-\\nates is adjusted to reflect the share in the associates’ net equity. If \\nthe financial statements of the associates are not available, the \\nshare of earnings or losses is recognized as necessary based on es-\\ntimated amounts. Goodwill arising from first-time consolidation is \\nreported using the equity method. Goodwill is not amortized, but \\nthe carrying amount of investments in associates consolidated us-\\ning the equity method is tested for impairment if there are relevant \\nindications. \\nJoint ventures are accounted for in the same way as associates. \\nCompanies that are dormant or have only a low level of business \\nactivity and therefore no significant impact on the earnings, finan-\\ncial and net assets position of the Continental Group are not included \\nin the consolidated financial statements. These are accounted for as \\nother investments at fair value (FVOCI).  \\nIntercompany receivables and payables, in addition to income and \\nexpenses, are eliminated on consolidation. Intercompany profits \\narising from internal transactions and dividend payments made \\nwithin the Continental Group are eliminated on consolidation. De-\\nferred taxes on the elimination of intercompany transactions are \\ncarried in the amount derived from the average income tax rate for \\nthe Continental Group. \\nCurrency translation \\nThe statements of financial position of foreign subsidiaries with a \\nfunctional currency other than the euro are translated into euros \\nusing the middle rate at the end of the reporting period (closing \\nrate). The income statements are translated at the average exchange \\nrate for the year. Differences resulting from currency translation are \\nrecognized in the difference from currency translation in equity un-\\ntil the disposal of the subsidiary, without recognizing deferred \\ntaxes. \\nIn the separate financial statements of Continental AG and its sub-\\nsidiaries, foreign-currency receivables and payables are measured \\non recognition at the transaction rate and adjusted at the end of \\nthe reporting period to the related closing rates. Gains and losses \\narising on currency translation are recognized in profit or loss, ex-\\ncept for certain loans. \\nGoodwill is recognized directly as an asset of the subsidiary acquired \\nand therefore also translated into euros for subsidiaries whose func-\\ntional currencies are not the euro at the end of the reporting period \\nusing the middle rate (closing rate). Differences resulting from cur-\\nrency translation are recognized in the difference from currency \\ntranslation in equity. \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n247\\nThe following table summarizes the exchange rates used in currency translation that had a material effect on the consolidated financial \\nstatements: \\nCurrencies \\n  \\nClosing rate \\nAverage rate for the year \\n€1 in \\n  \\nDec. 31, 2024 \\nDec. 31, 2023 \\n2024 \\n2023 \\nBrazil \\nBRL \\n6.43 \\n5.37 \\n5.83 \\n5.40 \\nSwitzerland \\nCHF \\n0.94 \\n0.93 \\n0.95 \\n0.97 \\nChina \\nCNY \\n7.60 \\n7.87 \\n7.79 \\n7.66 \\nCzech Republic \\nCZK \\n25.16 \\n24.71 \\n25.12 \\n24.01 \\nUnited Kingdom \\nGBP \\n0.83 \\n0.87 \\n0.85 \\n0.87 \\nHungary \\nHUF \\n410.86 \\n382.78 \\n395.41 \\n381.77 \\nJapan \\nJPY \\n163.34 \\n156.81 \\n163.81 \\n151.99 \\nSouth Korea \\nKRW \\n1,534.34 \\n1,428.58 \\n1,475.17 \\n1,413.09 \\nMexico \\nMXN \\n21.59 \\n18.78 \\n19.82 \\n19.19 \\nMalaysia \\nMYR \\n4.66 \\n5.08 \\n4.95 \\n4.93 \\nPhilippines \\nPHP \\n60.39 \\n61.28 \\n61.98 \\n60.17 \\nRomania \\nRON \\n4.97 \\n4.97 \\n4.97 \\n4.95 \\nUSA \\nUSD \\n1.04 \\n1.11 \\n1.08 \\n1.08 \\nSouth Africa \\nZAR \\n19.59 \\n20.48 \\n19.83 \\n19.96 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRevenue recognition \\nOnly sales of products and services resulting from the ordinary \\nbusiness activities of the company are shown as sales revenue.  \\nIn accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Custom-\\ners, Continental recognizes as revenue from contracts with custom-\\ners the amount that is received as consideration for the transfer of \\ngoods or services to customers. The relevant point in time or period \\nof time is the transfer of control of the goods or services to the cus-\\ntomer (control approach).  \\nTo determine when to recognize revenue and at what amount, the \\nfive-step model is applied. By applying the five-step model in the \\nContinental Group to contracts with customers, distinct performance \\nobligations are identified. The transaction price is determined – and \\nallocated to the performance obligations – according to the require-\\nments of IFRS 15. Variable consideration in contracts with custom-\\ners, such as rebates, bonus agreements or other kinds of price con-\\ncessions, is analyzed, measured and included in the revenue recog-\\nnition. The allocation of the transaction price in the case of more \\nthan one performance obligation at hand would be performed by \\nusing observable prices if possible. Otherwise the allocation would \\nbe performed using the adjusted market assessment approach or \\nthe approach of cost plus a margin. For every performance obliga-\\ntion that, in accordance with IFRS 15, is distinct within the context \\nof the contract, the revenue recognition is determined to be at a \\npoint in time or to be satisfied over time. \\nMulti-component contracts that contain distinct performance  \\nobligations with different timing of revenue recognition are not  \\ncurrently material.  \\nDescription of sales revenue in automotive original-\\nequipment business \\nThe type of performance obligations to customers in automotive \\noriginal-equipment business relates to the diverse and predomi-\\nnantly customer-specific products of the Automotive, Contract \\nManufacturing, and ContiTech segments, and the original-equip-\\nment business of the Tires segment; please refer to the information \\nprovided on the group sectors in the Structure of the Continental \\nGroup section of the consolidated management report. Invoices \\nare generally prepared once a month, while the payment terms  \\naverage 60 days and differ mostly depending on the region and/or \\nproduct group. Payments are made by bank transfer in the vast \\nmajority of cases. No significant discounts on the invoice amount \\nare granted; however, customer bonuses and other price reduc-\\ntions are included in the transaction price as variable price compo-\\nnents in line with expectations. The customers do not usually make \\nany significant advance payments. Revenue is almost always recog-\\nnized over time using an output-based measurement method, and \\nsales revenue is measured based on the products that leave the \\nproduction plant, as the products are produced and delivered “just \\nin time.” There are no significant obligations from the right of cus-\\ntomers to return products, or from reimbursements to customers \\nor similar obligations, or from warranty commitments that include  \\na service component.  \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n248\\nDescription of sales revenue in industrial and replacement \\nbusiness \\nThe type of performance obligations to customers in industrial  \\nand replacement business relates to the replacement-tire and retail \\nbusiness of the Tires segment, the industrial and retail business of \\nthe ContiTech segment, and the replacement-parts and retail busi-\\nness of the Automotive and Contract Manufacturing segments; \\nplease refer to the information provided on the group sectors in  \\nthe Structure of the Continental Group section of the consolidated \\nmanagement report. Invoices are generally prepared once a month, \\nwhile the payment terms for most of the sales average 60 days \\nand differ mostly depending on the region and/or product group. \\nPayments are made by bank transfer in the vast majority of cases, \\nwith the exception of business with end customers and consumers, \\nwho often pay in cash or by card. No significant discounts on the \\ninvoice amount are granted; however, customer bonuses and other \\nprice reductions are included in the transaction price as variable \\nprice components in line with expectations. The customers do not \\nusually make any significant advance payments. Revenue is recog-\\nnized at the point in time when control is transferred to the cus-\\ntomer, taking into account the agreed incoterms. There are no sig-\\nnificant obligations from the right of customers to return products, \\nor from reimbursements to customers or similar obligations, or \\nfrom warranty commitments that include a service component. \\nDescription of revenue in other business activities \\nRevenue in other business activities is included in the sales of the \\nautomotive original-equipment business, in the sales of the indus-\\ntrial and replacement business, and in other revenues. On the one \\nhand, services are provided and, on the other, project business is \\nconducted in which developments for customers are made, goods \\nproduced or services provided over a medium-term or longer pe-\\nriod. For this revenue, there are no significant obligations from the \\nright of customers to return products, or from reimbursements to \\ncustomers or similar obligations, or from warranty commitments \\nthat include a service component.  \\nThe largest component of this revenue relates to revenue from  \\nresearch and development, which is recognized at a point in time, \\neither when the entire development is completed or when identifia-\\nble milestones within a development are reached. Invoices are gen-\\nerally prepared after completion of a milestone or an entire devel-\\nopment and acceptance by the customer. Payments are made by \\nbank transfer in most cases. No significant discounts on the invoice \\namount are granted. The customers do not usually make any signif-\\nicant advance payments. \\nIn addition, services that are performed alongside the main busi-\\nness also lead to revenue recognition over time, though in smaller \\namounts. Both input- and output-based measurement methods are \\nused and sales are measured either based on the hours or days \\nworked or the costs incurred (input), or based on the services ren-\\ndered (output). Invoices are generally prepared at least once a \\nmonth, and payments are made by bank transfer in most cases. No \\nsignificant discounts on the invoice amount are granted. The cus-\\ntomers do not usually make any significant advance payments. \\nIn addition, project business is conducted, in which generally cus-\\ntomer-specific goods or services are produced or provided for cus-\\ntomers over a medium-term or longer period. Revenue from this is \\nlikewise recognized over time and sales are mostly measured using \\ninput-based measurement methods, taking account of the costs in-\\ncurred. Invoices are generally issued as contractually agreed. Ad-\\nvance payments averaging 30% are usually made by the custom-\\ners before the start of a project. Payments are made by bank trans-\\nfer in most cases. No significant discounts on the invoice amount \\nare granted.  \\nContract assets and contract liabilities \\nContract assets primarily arise in the project business from cus-\\ntomer-specific goods or services for customers, but are only of mi-\\nnor significance in the Continental Group. Contract assets must be \\nrecognized because the goods or services are provided over a me-\\ndium-term or longer period in which goods or services have al-\\nready been provided by Continental but there is not yet an uncon-\\nditional right against the customer, i.e. a receivable. The right – or \\npart of the right – to consideration from the customer is often only \\nunconditional once the provision of the services has been com-\\npleted and can then be recognized as a receivable and invoiced in \\nfull. The associated payments are generally made on the basis of \\nactual invoicing. The recognition of receivables and the receipt of \\npayments reduce the associated contract assets.  \\nContract liabilities include mainly advance payments by customers \\nfor deliveries of goods and for services to be performed. In the \\ncase of these advance payments by customers for deliveries of \\ngoods and for services to be performed, the customer has already \\npaid the consideration – or part of the consideration – but Conti-\\nnental has generally not yet satisfied its performance obligation,  \\nor has done so only to a limited extent. The provision of the corre-\\nsponding services to the customers by Continental reduces the \\nlevel of the associated contract liabilities. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n249\\nResearch and development expenses \\nResearch and development expenses comprise expenditure on re-\\nsearch and development and expenses for customer-specific appli-\\ncations, prototypes and testing. Where refunds from customers for \\nresearch and development expenses are agreed, these costs are \\nrecognized in inventories until control is transferred. Once control is \\ntransferred, the refund amounts are stated under other income. In \\naddition, the expenses are reduced by the amount relating to the \\napplication of research results from the development of new or \\nsubstantially improved products, if the related activity fulfills the \\nrecognition criteria for internally generated intangible assets set \\nout in IAS 38, Intangible Assets. This portion of the expenses is cap-\\nitalized as an asset and amortized over a period of three to seven \\nyears from the date that the developed products become marketa-\\nble. However, expenses for customer-specific applications, pre-pro-\\nduction prototypes or tests for products already being marketed do \\nnot qualify as development expenditure which may be recognized \\nas an intangible asset. Furthermore, expenses incurred directly in \\nconnection with the launch of new production operations and \\nplants are recognized directly in profit or loss. \\nNew developments for the original-equipment business are not \\nmarketable until Continental AG has been nominated as the sup-\\nplier for the particular vehicle platform or model and, furthermore, \\nhas successfully fulfilled pre-production release stages. Moreover, \\nthese release stages serve as the prerequisite to demonstrate the \\ntechnical feasibility of the product, especially given the high de-\\nmands imposed on safety and comfort technology. Accordingly, de-\\nvelopment costs are recognized as an asset only as at the date of \\nnomination as supplier and upon fulfillment of a specific prepro-\\nduction release stage. The development is considered to be com-\\npleted once the final approval for the unlimited production is \\ngranted. Only very few development projects fulfill the recognition \\ncriteria. \\nAlthough suppliers are nominated by original equipment manufac-\\nturers with the general obligation to supply products over the entire \\nlife of the particular model or platform, these supply agreements \\nconstitute neither long-term contracts nor firm commitments, in \\nparticular because the original equipment manufacturers make no \\ncommitments in regard to purchase quantities. For this reason, all \\npre-production expenses – with the exception of the capitalized de-\\nvelopment costs as previously described – are recognized immedi-\\nately in profit or loss. \\nProduct-related expenses \\nCosts for advertising, sales promotion and other sales-related items \\nare expensed as incurred. Provisions are recognized for possible \\nwarranty claims on sold products on the basis of past experience, \\nas well as legal and contractual terms. Additional provisions are rec-\\nognized for specific known cases. \\nFinancial result and investment income  \\nInterest income and expenses are recognized for the period to \\nwhich they relate.  \\nDividends are recognized in profit or loss if legal entitlement to  \\npayment of the dividend is established, the economic benefit asso-\\nciated with the dividend is likely to be received, and the dividend \\namount can be measured reliably. \\nEarnings per share  \\nBasic earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted \\naverage number of shares issued. Treasury stock is deducted for the \\nperiod it is held. Diluted earnings per share also include shares from \\nthe potential exercise of option or conversion rights. The correspond-\\ning expenses that would no longer be incurred after the conversion \\nor exchange are eliminated. \\nStatement of financial position classification \\nAssets and liabilities are reported as non-current assets and liabili-\\nties in the statement of financial position if they have a remaining \\nterm of over one year and, conversely, as current assets and liabili-\\nties if the remaining term is shorter. Liabilities are treated as current \\nif there is no right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 \\nmonths after the end of the reporting period. Pension provisions, \\nprovisions for other post-employment benefits, and other employee \\nbenefits, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted \\nfor as non-current. If assets and liabilities have both current and \\nnon-current portions, the amounts are classified separately and \\nshown as current and non-current assets or liabilities. \\nGoodwill \\nGoodwill corresponds to the difference between the acquisition \\ncost and the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities of the \\nbusiness combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization; it is \\ntested for impairment at least annually and, if necessary, impaired. \\nThe details of the annual impairment test are described under  \\n“Impairment” in this note. Once an impairment loss has been  \\nrecognized on goodwill, it is not reversed in subsequent periods. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n250\\nIntangible assets \\nPurchased intangible assets are carried at acquisition costs and  \\ninternally generated intangible assets at their production costs, pro-\\nvided that the conditions for recognition of an internally generated \\nintangible asset are met in accordance with IAS 38, Intangible As-\\nsets. If intangible assets have finite useful lives, they are amortized \\non a straight-line basis over a useful life of three to eight years in \\ngeneral. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at \\nleast annually for impairment and, if necessary, impaired. \\nThe details of the annual impairment test are described under  \\n“Impairment” in this note. \\nProperty, plant and equipment \\nProperty, plant and equipment is measured at cost less straight-line \\ndepreciation. If necessary, additional impairment is recognized on \\nthe affected items. \\nProduction cost consists of the direct costs and attributable mate-\\nrial and manufacturing overheads, including depreciation. \\nUnder certain conditions, portions of the borrowing costs are capi-\\ntalized as part of the acquisition cost. This also applies to invest-\\nment property. \\nAs soon as an asset is available for its intended use, subsequent cost \\nis capitalized only to the extent the related modification changes the \\nfunction of the asset or increases its economic value and the cost \\ncan be clearly identified. All other subsequent expenditure is recog-\\nnized as current maintenance expense. \\nProperty, plant and equipment is broken down into the lowest level \\nof the components that have significantly different useful lives and, \\nto the extent integrated in other assets, when they are likely to be \\nreplaced or overhauled during the overall life of the related main \\nasset. Maintenance and repair costs are recognized in profit or loss \\nas incurred. The Continental Group has no property, plant or equip-\\nment that by the nature of its operation and deployment can be re-\\npaired and serviced only in intervals over several years. The useful \\nlives are up to 25 years for buildings and land improvements; up  \\nto 20 years for technical equipment and machinery; and up to 12 \\nyears for operating and office equipment.  \\nWhen assets are sold, closed down or scrapped, the difference be-\\ntween the net proceeds and the net carrying amount of the assets is \\nrecognized as gain or loss in other income or expense, respectively. \\nGovernment grants \\nGovernment grants are reported if there is reasonable assurance \\nthat the conditions in place in connection with the grants will be \\nfulfilled and that the grants will be awarded. \\nMonetary government grants and government subsidies that are \\ndirectly attributable to depreciable fixed assets are deducted from \\nthe procurement and manufacturing costs of the assets in ques-\\ntion. All other monetary grants and subsidies are recognized as in-\\ncome in line with planning and are presented alongside the corre-\\nsponding expenses. Non-monetary government grants are recog-\\nnized at fair value. \\nInvestment property \\nLand and buildings held for the purpose of generating rental in-\\ncome instead of production or administrative purposes are carried \\nat depreciated cost. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis \\nover the useful lives, which correspond to those for real estate in \\nuse by the company. \\nLeases \\nA contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right \\nto control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in ex-\\nchange for consideration. A lessee shall recognize a right-of-use as-\\nset and a corresponding lease liability, which represents the lessee’s \\nobligation to make lease payments. \\nThe lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease pay-\\nments not yet made. It is recognized under indebtedness. Discount-\\ning is determined using the incremental borrowing rates, as the in-\\nterest rates underlying the leases often cannot be determined reg-\\nularly. The right-of-use-asset recognized by the lessee is measured \\nat cost. This amount comprises the corresponding lease liability \\nand prepaid lease payments, taking into account any lease incen-\\ntives received. It is recognized in property, plant and equipment. \\nDepreciation is charged on a straight-line basis. The lease liability is \\nsubsequently measured according to the effective interest method. \\nThe resulting interest expense is recognized in the financial result. \\nContinental utilizes the exemptions for short-term leases and for \\nleases in which the underlying asset is of low value.  \\nContinental leases property, plant and equipment, especially buildings. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n251\\nAs lessor, Continental classifies leases as operating leases or finance \\nleases. For this classification, Continental considers whether the \\nlease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to \\nownership of an underlying asset. If this is the case, it is a finance \\nlease; otherwise, it is an operating lease. \\nIf Continental acts as an intermediate lessor, the interests arising \\nfrom the head lease and sublease are accounted for separately. The \\nsublease is classified based on the right-of-use asset resulting from \\nthe head lease rather than based on the underlying asset. If the \\nhead lease is a short-term lease for which the Continental Group \\napplies the exemption provision, it classifies the sublease as an op-\\nerating lease. \\nBesides the products acquired from the Schaeffler Group/Vitesco \\nTechnologies (until the merger on October 1, 2024) on the basis of \\nthe related framework agreement, IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts \\nwith Customers, is applied when allocating the consideration to in-\\ndividual lease and non-lease components. \\nImpairment \\nThe Continental Group immediately reviews intangible assets and \\nproperty, plant and equipment, investment property and goodwill \\nas soon as there is an indication of impairment (triggering event). \\nImpairment is assessed by comparing the carrying amount with \\nthe recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of \\nthe fair value less cost of disposal and the present value of the ex-\\npected future cash flows from the continued use of the asset (value \\nin use). If the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount, \\nthe difference is recognized as impairment. If the indications for the \\nprior recognition of impairment no longer apply, the impairment \\nlosses are reversed for intangible assets, property, plant and equip-\\nment, and investment property. \\nCapitalized goodwill is generally tested for impairment once a year \\nas at November 30 at the level of cash-generating units (CGUs). \\nCGUs are units that come below the segments and are the smallest \\nidentifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are \\nlargely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups \\nof assets. This represents the level at which goodwill is monitored \\nfor internal management purposes. The impairment test is per-\\nformed by comparing the carrying amount of the CGU including its \\ngoodwill and the recoverable amount of this CGU. The recoverable \\namount in this case is the value in use calculated on the basis of \\ndiscounted cash flows before interest and tax. Impairment is recog-\\nnized to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable \\namount for a CGU. If the reasons for this cease to apply in the  \\nfuture, impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. \\nThe expected cash flows of the CGUs are derived from long-term \\nplanning that usually covers the next five years and is approved by \\nmanagement. For the Autonomous Mobility CGU, expected cash \\nflow data is derived from its long-term planning that covers the \\nnext 11 years (PY: eight years). The plans are based in particular  \\non assumptions regarding macroeconomic developments, as well \\nas trends in sales prices, raw material prices and exchange rates \\nderived in part from external sources. In addition to these current \\nmarket forecasts, past developments and experience are also taken \\ninto account. Furthermore, Continental’s internal CO2 shadow price \\nis also taken into account in the assumptions; for further details on \\nits calculation, please refer to the consolidated management report. \\nFor the perpetuity beyond the period of five years, the cash flow is \\nextrapolated using the expected long-term growth rates for the in-\\ndividual CGUs. \\nThe main assumptions when calculating the value in use of a CGU \\nare the free cash flows, the discount rate and its parameters, and \\nthe long-term growth rate. \\nAnnual impairment testing was performed on the basis of the bot-\\ntom-up business plan for the next five years approved by manage-\\nment in the period under review. The cash flows of the CGUs of the \\nAutomotive segment were discounted with an interest rate before \\ntax of 12.4% (PY: 13.1%), those of the Tires segment with an inter-\\nest rate of 12.4% (PY: 11.5%), those of the ContiTech segment with \\nan interest rate of 12.6% (PY: 11.9%) and those of the Contract \\nManufacturing segment with an interest rate of 12.4% (PY: 13.1%). \\nThis pre-tax WACC is based on the capital structure of the respec-\\ntive relevant peer group on average over the last five years. The \\nrisk-free interest rate is 2.50% (PY: 2.62%) and the market risk pre-\\nmium 7.0% (PY: 7.0%). Borrowing costs correspond to the interest \\nrate on industrial bonds, with the average rating derived via the \\npeer group. \\nFor the annual impairment test, the average growth rate in the de-\\ntailed planning period was 6.4% (PY: 8.8%) for the CGUs of the Au-\\ntomotive segment, 3.9% (PY: 5.6%) for those of the Tires segment \\nand 4.3% (PY: 4.9%) for those of the ContiTech segment. Contract \\nmanufacturing for the Schaeffler Group/Vitesco Technologies (until \\nthe merger on October 1, 2024) is reported in the Contract Manu-\\nfacturing segment and will conclude by the end of the detailed \\nplanning period. The long-term growth rate was 1.0% (PY: 1.0%) for \\nthe CGUs of the Automotive segment and 0.5% (PY: 0.5%) for those \\nof the Tires and ContiTech segments, with the exception of the \\nOriginal Equipment Solutions CGU. The long-term growth rate for \\nthe Original Equipment Solutions CGU of the ContiTech segment \\nwas 1.0% (PY: 0.5%). These growth rates do not exceed the long-\\nterm average growth rates for the markets in which the CGUs  \\noperate. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n252\\nThe annual impairment testing of goodwill determined no require-\\nments for impairment for 2024. This outcome was confirmed by \\nan additional impairment test as at December 31, 2024. In the \\nOriginal Equipment CGU of the Tires segment, the carrying amount \\nexceeded the value in use. As there was no significant goodwill, the \\nrecoverability of the individual assets was reviewed, whereby these \\nare mainly production-related machines and buildings that are not \\nused exclusively by the Original Equipment CGU, but are also used \\nby the three CGUs Replacement EMEA (Europe, the Middle East \\nand Africa), Replacement APAC (Asia-Pacific region) and Replace-\\nment The Americas (North, Central and South America). This review \\ndid not reveal any need for impairment, since the fair value less \\ncosts of disposal for the individual assets exceeds their respective \\ncarrying amount. Fair values were derived on the basis of valuation \\nreports relating to the properties and current market values for \\ncomparable machinery and technical equipment, among other \\nthings. \\nAssuming a 0.5-percentage-point increase in the discount rate \\nwould not lead to any goodwill impairment. No asset impairment \\nwould result. Reducing the long-term growth rate by 0.5 percent-\\nage points would not lead to any goodwill impairment. No asset im-\\npairment would result. If sales in perpetuity would decline by 5.0%, \\nconsequently reducing free cash flow as a key planning parameter, \\nthis would not lead to any goodwill impairment. No asset impair-\\nment would result. \\nAssets held for sale and related liabilities \\nA non-current asset (or disposal group) is classified as held for sale \\nand is presented separately in the statement of financial position  \\nif its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale \\ntransaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the \\ncase, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate \\nsale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual \\nand customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups) and its \\nsale must be highly probable. \\nA non-current asset (or disposal group) held for sale is measured  \\nat the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell \\nwhere it meets the held for sale criteria. Depreciation of these as-\\nsets ceases once they are classified as held for sale. Immediately \\nbefore the initial classification of the asset (or disposal group) as \\nheld for sale, the carrying amounts shall be measured in accord-\\nance with the applicable IFRS.  \\nA non-current asset (or disposal group) is classified as held for distri-\\nbution to owners when the entity is committed to distribute the asset \\n(or disposal group) to the owners. For this to be the case, the assets \\nmust be available for immediate distribution in their present condi-\\ntion and the distribution must be highly probable. A non-current as-\\nset (or disposal group) held for distribution is measured at the lower \\nof its carrying amount and fair value less costs to distribute. \\nOn subsequent remeasurement of a disposal group, the carrying \\namounts of any assets and liabilities that are not within the scope \\nof the measurement requirements of IFRS 5, Non-current Assets \\nHeld for Sale and Discontinued Operations, but are included in a \\ndisposal group classified as held for sale, shall be remeasured in  \\naccordance with the applicable IFRS before the fair value less costs \\nto sell of the disposal group is remeasured. \\nA discontinued operation can also be classified as held for sale un-\\nder IFRS 5. A discontinued operation is a component of an entity \\nthat either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and \\nrepresents a separate major line of business or geographical area \\nof operations, is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a \\nseparate major line of business or geographical area of operations, \\nor is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The \\nclassification of a component of an entity as a discontinued opera-\\ntion is also appropriate in the case of classification as held for distri-\\nbution, provided the criteria are met. \\nFinancial instruments \\nA financial instrument, as defined in IAS 32, Financial Instruments: \\nPresentation, is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one \\nentity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. \\nIn the Continental Group, a purchase or sale of financial assets or fi-\\nnancial liabilities is recognized or derecognized at the settlement \\ndate. \\nFinancial assets  \\nFinancial assets are recognized in the statement of financial position \\nas at the date Continental becomes a contractual party to the finan-\\ncial instrument. At the acquisition date, they must be classified into \\nmeasurement categories that determine the subsequent accounting.  \\nReceivables from the receivables factoring programs carried out in \\nthe Continental Group are recognized in the statement of financial \\nposition when the risks and rewards, in particular credit and default \\nrisk, have not been essentially transferred. The repayment obligations \\ntherefrom are, as a rule, then shown as short-term financial liabilities. \\nThe classification and measurement of financial assets that constitute \\ndebt instruments is based on the business model in which the assets \\nare managed and on their cash flow characteristics. These conditions \\nare cumulative criteria whose audit sequence is irrelevant.  \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n253\\nIt is therefore necessary to analyze the business model in which \\nthe asset to be classified is held. This relates to the investigation of \\nthe way in which financial assets held in order to collect cash flows \\nare managed. The Continental Group reclassifies debt instruments \\nif the corresponding business model changes. \\nIFRS 9, Financial Instruments, distinguishes between three business \\nmodels: \\n› Hold-to-collect: The objective of this business model is to hold the \\nfinancial assets and generate the contractual cash flows. This \\nmodel is the prevalent business model in the Continental Group. \\n› Hold-to-collect and sale: This business model aims to collect the \\ncontractual cash flows or sell the financial assets. This business \\nmodel does occur – for example, in connection with notes receiv-\\nable – but is fundamentally of subordinate importance in the \\nContinental Group. \\n› Other: This business model constitutes a catch-all category. This \\nmodel occurs in the Continental Group in connection with recog-\\nnized trade accounts receivable from third parties which will \\nprobably be sold under a true sale-of-receivables factoring agree-\\nment; however, it is fundamentally of subordinate importance in \\nthe Continental Group. \\nIn addition to the analysis of the business model, the contractual \\nterms applicable on acquisition of the financial instrument must \\nalso be assessed (SPPI (solely payments of principal and interest) \\ncriterion). The SPPI criterion is met when the contractual terms of \\nthe financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are \\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount \\noutstanding. Contractual cash flows that are solely payments of \\nprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are  \\nconsistent with a basic lending arrangement.  \\nOn the basis of the aforementioned conditions, a distinction is \\ndrawn between the following measurement categories for financial \\nassets that constitute debt instruments: \\n› Measured at cost: The financial asset, which constitutes a debt in-\\nstrument, is held within a business model whose objective is to \\nhold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. Furthermore, \\nthe contractual cash flows can be characterized as payments of \\nprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Inter-\\nest income is recognized in the financial result using the effective \\ninterest method. Gains or losses arising from derecognition are \\nrecognized in profit or loss together with the foreign-currency \\ngains and losses under other operating income or expenses, or  \\nin the financial result. Impairment losses are likewise recognized \\nseparately in the income statement.  \\n› Measured at fair value through other comprehensive income with \\nreclassification (FVOCIwR): The financial asset, which constitutes \\na debt instrument, is held within a business model whose objec-\\ntive is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and sell-\\ning financial assets. Furthermore, the contractual cash flows can \\nbe characterized as payments of principal and interest on the \\nprincipal amount outstanding. Changes in the carrying amount \\nare recognized in other comprehensive income. Income or ex-\\npenses from impairment, interest income and foreign-currency \\ngains and losses are recognized in profit or loss. The cumulative \\ngain or loss stated in other comprehensive income is reclassified \\nfrom equity to the income statement when the financial asset is \\nderecognized. Interest income is recognized in the financial result \\nusing the effective interest method. Foreign-currency gains and \\nlosses are recognized in other income and expenses.  \\n› Measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL): The financial \\nasset, which constitutes a debt instrument, is not to be measured \\nat cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income with \\nreclassification (FVOCIwR), as either the SPPI criterion was not \\nmet or the “Other” business model applies. Classification to the \\n“measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)” category \\ncan also be appropriate if the fair value option is applied to debt \\ninstruments that should actually be classified as measured at cost \\nor at fair value through other comprehensive income with reclas-\\nsification (FVOCIwR). However, the Continental Group does not \\ncurrently intend to apply the fair value option to debt instruments. \\nIncome or expense from a financial asset measured at fair value \\nthrough profit or loss is recognized in the income statement. \\nInvestments that fall within the scope of IFRS 9, Financial Instru-\\nments, and meet the definition of equity must generally be meas-\\nured at fair value. For equity instruments that are neither held for \\ntrading nor constitute contingent consideration accounted for by \\nthe acquirer in a business combination according to IFRS 3, Busi-\\nness Combinations, the Continental Group decides at the acquisi-\\ntion date for each (equity) instrument whether to exercise the op-\\ntion of recognizing changes in fair value in other comprehensive in-\\ncome (fair value OCI option). The cumulative gain or loss in other \\ncomprehensive income is not reclassified to the income statement \\nwhen the financial asset is derecognized. This results in the meas-\\nurement category of fair value through other comprehensive in-\\ncome without reclassification (FVOCIwoR). Dividends are an excep-\\ntion to this and continue to be recognized in profit or loss when the \\nlegal entitlement is established, unless this relates to a partial resti-\\ntution of acquisition costs. Dividends are recognized in other in-\\ncome from investments. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n254\\nEquity instruments held for trading purposes or for which the fair \\nvalue OCI option is not utilized are without exception accounted for \\nat fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). \\nOn initial recognition, the Continental Group measures a financial \\nasset at fair value plus the transaction costs directly attributable to \\nthe acquisition, with the exception of financial assets measured at \\nfair value through profit or loss, for which associated transaction \\ncosts are recognized as expense in the income statement.  \\nImpairment is recognized using the expected loss model. The im-\\npairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortized \\ncost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) \\n(except for investments in equity instruments), contract assets that \\nresult from IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, lease \\nreceivables, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.  \\nLoss allowances are measured on the basis of 12-month expected \\ncredit losses or on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses. 12-\\nmonth expected credit losses result from possible default events \\nwithin 12 months after the reporting date. Lifetime expected credit \\nlosses result from all possible default events over the expected life \\nof a financial instrument.  \\nLifetime expected credit loss measurement applies if the credit risk \\nof a financial asset at the reporting date has increased significantly \\nsince initial recognition, and 12-month expected credit loss meas-\\nurement applies if it has not. The credit risk of a financial asset has \\nincreased significantly since initial recognition when contractual \\npayments are more than 30 days past due on the reporting date. \\nFor trade accounts receivable and contract assets with and without \\nsignificant financing components, lease payments receivable and \\ncurrent receivables from related parties, only lifetime expected \\ncredit loss measurement is applied. Under this approach, the life-\\ntime expected credit losses must be recognized from the initial \\nrecognition of the receivable. \\nA financial asset is in default or credit-impaired if one of the follow-\\ning criteria is met: \\n› Insolvency or a similar event that indicates significant financial \\ndifficulty and a probable default of the counterparty.  \\n› Probable debt waiver. \\n› A breach of contract that leads to the assumption that it is more \\nprobable that one or more receivables are not collectible. \\n› Other reasons in the assessment of credit management that lead \\nto the assumption that it is more probable that the receivables \\nare not collectible. \\nIf there is evidence of uncollectibility, the financial asset is derecog-\\nnized. If creditworthiness improves, the allowance is reversed. \\nThe Continental Group regularly reviews the expected credit loss \\nmodel in accordance with IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, to identify \\npotential effects on the model and make any necessary adjust-\\nments. The outcome of this review and any potential adjustments \\nat the end of the reporting period are described under “Default \\nrisks.” \\nFinancial liabilities \\nFinancial liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial posi-\\ntion as at the date Continental becomes a contractual party to the \\nfinancial instrument. \\nFinancial liabilities are generally measured at amortized cost using \\nthe effective interest method. Instruments that are held for trading \\nare classified as “financial liabilities measured at fair value through \\nprofit or loss.” For financial liabilities not held for trading, the fair \\nvalue option can be exercised. If the fair value option is used, the \\nportion of the change in the fair value due to changes in the credit \\nrisk of the liability is recognized in other comprehensive income. \\nThe fair value option is not currently exercised in the Continental \\nGroup. In the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG, \\nall non-derivative financial liabilities are measured at amortized \\ncost, which as a rule comprises the remaining principal balance \\nand issuing costs, net of any unamortized premium or discount. Fi-\\nnancial obligations with fixed or determinable payments that com-\\nprise neither financial liabilities nor derivative financial liabilities and \\nare not quoted in an active market are reported in the statement of \\nfinancial position under other financial liabilities in accordance with \\ntheir term.  \\nIn the case of information reported in accordance with IFRS 7, Fi-\\nnancial Instruments: Disclosures, classification is in line with the \\nitems disclosed in the statement of financial position and/or the \\nmeasurement category used in accordance with IFRS 9, Financial \\nInstruments. \\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting \\nDerivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through \\nprofit or loss (FVPL). The fair value is generally the market or ex-\\nchange price. In the absence of an active market, the fair value is \\ndetermined using financial models.  \\nFair values of currency forwards are calculated by way of future \\ncash flows being translated into one of the two currencies using \\nforward rates, netted, discounted with risk-free interest rates and \\nthen translated into the functional currency of the respective sub-\\nsidiary at current spot exchange rates if applicable (par method).  \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n255\\nThe value of options is determined by applying recognized option \\npricing models.  \\nTo calculate the fair value of interest-rate swaps and cross-currency \\ninterest-rate swaps, the future cash flows are discounted with the \\ninterest rates for the respective maturities, with primarily deposit \\nrates, risk-free interest rates or IBOR rates used as short-term inter-\\nest rates while long-term interest rates are based on the swap rates \\nin the respective currency. Future cash flows are forecast using in-\\nterest-rate curves with an appropriate payment tenor. When dis-\\ncounting, currency basis spreads or, if applicable, tenor basis \\nspreads are taken into account. \\nThe measurement of derivative instruments takes into account the \\ncredit spread in general.  \\nDerivative instruments are recognized at the date when the obliga-\\ntion to buy or sell the instrument arises. \\nHedge accounting is currently not applied.  \\nThe amount of the effective portion of the change in value of the \\nhedges remaining from the hedging of foreign-currency risks from \\nnet investments in foreign operations is still recognized together \\nwith the effect from the currency translation of the net investment \\nin the difference from currency translation in equity. The accumu-\\nlated currency effects are not reclassified in profit and loss until the \\nforeign operations are sold or liquidated. \\nEmbedded derivatives \\nAn embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract \\nalongside a non-derivative host contract. A portion of the cash \\nflows of the hybrid contract is therefore subject to similar variability \\nas a separate derivative. \\nNon-derivative host contracts, with the exception of financial as-\\nsets, are regularly inspected within the Continental Group for em-\\nbedded derivatives. \\nIf the host contract does not fall under the scope of IFRS 9 or if the \\nhost contract is a financial liability, embedded derivatives must be \\nseparated from the host contract if the assessment finds that the \\neconomic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are \\nnot closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the \\nhost contract, a separate instrument with the same terms would \\nmeet the definition of a derivative and Continental does not exer-\\ncise the option to measure the entire hybrid instrument at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss.  \\nIf separation is appropriate, the host contract is accounted for in ac-\\ncordance with the relevant IFRS requirements. The embedded de-\\nrivative is recognized at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL).  \\nInventories \\nInventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable \\nvalue. Acquisition cost is generally determined using the weighted-\\naverage method. Production cost includes direct costs, production-\\nrelated material costs, overheads and depreciation. Inventory risks \\nresulting from decreased marketability or excessive storage periods \\nare accounted for with write-downs. \\nOther assets  \\nOther assets are recognized at amortized cost. Allowances are  \\nrecognized as appropriate to reflect any possible risk related to  \\nrecoverability. \\nAccounting for income taxes \\nIncome taxes are measured using the concept of the statement of \\nfinancial position liability method in accordance with IAS 12, Income \\nTaxes. Tax expenses and refunds that relate to income are recog-\\nnized as income taxes. Late payment fines and interest arising from \\nsubsequently assessed taxes are not reported under the item in-\\ncome tax expense, but rather as interest income and expense. \\nCurrent taxes owed on income are recognized as expenses when \\nthey are incurred. They are determined taking into account the re-\\nspective local tax laws and relevant case law. The complexity of \\nthese regulations and the possible differences in interpretation be-\\ntween taxpayers on the one hand and local tax authorities on the \\nother may lead to uncertainties regarding the handling of individ-\\nual facts and circumstances. These uncertain tax positions are \\nmeasured in accordance with IFRIC 23 as the most likely amount. \\nOwing to the lack of an unrestricted market comparison, determin-\\ning prices for cross-border intercompany transactions is extremely \\ncomplex and therefore subject to uncertainty. In the Continental \\nGroup, prices are therefore regularly determined on the basis of the \\ninternationally recognized arm’s length principle, taking into ac-\\ncount the transfer pricing methods specified by lawmakers and the \\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \\nIf there are multiple tax uncertainties and a correlation between \\nthem and certain tax parameters, they are presented in the finan-\\ncial statements either individually or as a group, depending on how \\nthe risk is realized.  \\nDeferred taxes include expected tax payments and refunds from \\ntemporary differences between the carrying amounts in the con-\\nsolidated financial statements and the related tax bases, as well as \\nfrom the utilization of loss carryforwards. No deferred tax is recog-\\nnized for non-tax-deductible goodwill. The deferred tax assets and \\nliabilities are measured at the applicable tax rates related to the pe-\\nriod when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. \\nChanges in tax rates are recognized once the rate has been sub-\\nstantially enacted. Deferred tax assets are not recognized if it is not \\nprobable that they will be realized in the future. \\nIn a country-specific review, the extent to which tax-related risks \\nthat are likely to occur can or must be offset against losses or loss \\ncarryforwards in the individual countries or tax groups is analyzed. \\nIf there is a need for offsetting in the countries or tax groups, the \\nprobable tax-related risks are offset against the associated losses \\nand loss carryforwards. As a result, the disclosure of deferred taxes \\non loss carryforwards includes a risk adjustment for the Continen-\\ntal Group units affected.  \\nIncome tax receivables and liabilities are recognized as current \\nitems, as they are due immediately and this due date often cannot \\nbe deferred.  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n256\\nThe Continental Group falls within the scope of the regulations \\nknown as the Pillar Two Model Rules of the OECD governing a \\nglobal minimum corporate tax rate, which have been carried over \\ninto German law under the Minimum Tax Act (Mindeststeuergesetz \\n– MinStG). In addition, related provisions for the collection of a local \\nminimum tax have been introduced in the countries in which the \\nContinental Group operates.  \\nThe Continental Group makes use of the exemption from account-\\ning for deferred taxes in connection with Pillar Two income taxes, \\nwhich was the subject of the amendments to IAS 12 published in \\nMay 2023. \\nThe minimum tax is levied at the level of INA-Holding Schaeffler \\nGmbH & Co. KG, Herzogenaurach, Germany, as the parent com-\\npany of the IHO Group (ultimate parent entity) and group parent. \\nWithin the framework of the requirements stipulated by the mini-\\nmum tax regulations, Continental AG, as the parent company of the \\nContinental Group, acts as a partially owned parent entity. Conti-\\nnental AG is included in the consolidated financial statements of \\nINA-Holding Schaeffler GmbH & Co. KG, Herzogenaurach, Germany, \\nand, for this reason, is jointly assessed with the other companies of \\nthe IHO Group when determining the minimum tax. Continental AG \\nis obligated in accordance with Section 3 (6) MinStG to compen-\\nsate INA-Holding Schaeffler GmbH & Co. KG, Herzogenaurach, Ger-\\nmany, for the share of the minimum tax attributable to Continental \\nAG. Owing to the recognized national top-up taxes, it is possible \\nthat the duty to pay the minimum tax due may fall on group sub-\\nsidiaries other than Continental AG. \\nThe rules governing the global minimum tax stipulate that, per \\ncountry, the difference between the effective tax rate in accordance \\nwith the global minimum tax rules and the 15% minimum tax rate – \\nbased on the adjusted minimum tax profit – is to be paid as the mini-\\nmum tax by the ultimate parent entity, i.e. INA-Holding Schaeffler \\nGmbH & Co. KG, Herzogenaurach, Germany. In a transition period \\nfor the fiscal years 2024 through 2026, so-called safe harbor rules \\nlinked to the fulfillment of certain criteria may be utilized that allow \\ncompanies to dispense with the exact calculation of the minimum \\ntax, with the minimum tax being set at zero in such cases. \\nEmployee benefits  \\nThe retirement benefits offered by the Continental Group comprise \\nboth defined benefit and defined contribution plans.  \\nPension provisions under defined benefit plans are actuarially \\nmeasured pursuant to IAS 19, Employee Benefits (revised 2011), \\nusing the projected unit credit method that reflects salary, pension \\nand employee fluctuation trends. The discount rate to determine \\nthe present value is based on long-term loans in the respective cap-\\nital market. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other com-\\nprehensive income. Expenses from interest cost on pension liabili-\\nties and income from pension funds are reported net in the financial \\nresult. \\nAccordingly, the interest effects of other long-term employee bene-\\nfits are reported in the financial result. Pension liabilities for some \\ncompanies of the Continental Group are covered by pension funds. \\nFurthermore, plan assets comprise all assets, as well as claims from \\ninsurance contracts, that are held exclusively toward payments to \\nthose entitled to pensions and are not available to meet the claims \\nof other creditors. Pension obligations and plan assets are reported \\non a net basis in the statement of financial position. \\nThe other post-employment benefits also shown under the em-\\nployee benefits relate to obligations to pay for health costs for  \\nretired workers in the USA and Canada in particular. \\nDefined contribution plans represent retirement benefits where the \\ncompany only contributes contractually fixed amounts for current \\nservice entitlements, which are generally invested by independent, \\nexternal asset managers until the date of retirement of the em-\\nployee. The fixed amounts are partly dependent on the level of the \\nemployee’s own contribution. The company gives no guarantees of \\nthe value of the asset after the fixed contribution, either at the re-\\ntirement date or beyond. The entitlement is therefore settled by the \\ncontributions paid in the year. \\nProvisions for other risks and obligations \\nProvisions are recognized when a legal or constructive obligation \\nhas arisen that is likely to result in a future cash outflow to third par-\\nties and the amount can be reliably determined or estimated. The \\nprovisions are recognized as at the end of the reporting period at \\nthe value at which the obligations could probably be settled or \\ntransferred to a third party. Non-current provisions such as those \\nfor litigation or environmental risks are discounted to their present \\nvalue. The resulting periodic interest charge for the provisions is \\nshown under the financial result including an effect from a change \\nin interest. \\nNon-financial liabilities \\nCurrent non-financial liabilities are carried at their settlement amount. \\nNon-current non-financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. \\nShare-based payments  \\nCash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value us-\\ning a Monte Carlo simulation. The liabilities are recognized under \\nemployee benefits until the end of the holding period. Equity-set-\\ntled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the \\ngranted equity instruments. \\nEstimates \\nProper and complete preparation of the consolidated financial \\nstatements requires management to make estimates and assump-\\ntions affecting the amount and disclosure of the recognized assets \\nand liabilities, income and expenses as well as the disclosures in \\nthe notes for the reporting period. \\nThe significant assumptions and estimates in the reporting period \\nrelated to: \\n› the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets and \\nproperty, plant and equipment.  \\n› the impairment testing of goodwill and non-current assets, in  \\nparticular the underlying cash flow forecasts and discount rates \\n(determination of the recoverable).  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n257\\n› the identification of impairment losses or reversals of impairment \\nlosses on intangible assets. \\n› the identification of impairment losses or reversals of impairment \\nlosses on inventories. \\n› the identification of intangible assets and their measurement \\nwithin the scope of company acquisitions. \\n› the assessment of the recoverability of receivables and other  \\nfinancial assets (impairment amount). \\n› the determination of fair values with regard to financial assets \\nand liabilities.  \\n› the recognition and measurement of income tax payables and \\ndeferred taxes on temporary differences, and the recognition of \\ndeferred tax assets on losses carried forward. \\n› the assessment of technical and economic feasibility when capi-\\ntalizing development costs. \\n› the recognition and measurement of leases. \\n› the measurement of revenue reductions and reimbursement  \\nliabilities within the scope of revenue recognition. \\n› the actuarial parameters influencing share-based payments. \\n› the recognition and measurement of liabilities and provisions, in \\nparticular the actuarial parameters for pensions and similar obli-\\ngations used to determine defined benefit obligations. \\n› the point in time at which assets and liabilities are classified as \\nheld for sale. \\n› the recognition and measurement of provisions and contingent \\nliabilities, in particular with regard to the parameters for measur-\\ning restructuring provisions, as well as the probability of occur-\\nrence and the amount of warranty, litigation and environmental \\nrisks. \\nThe assumptions and estimates are based on the information cur-\\nrently available at the date of preparation of the consolidated finan-\\ncial statements. The underlying information is regularly reviewed \\nand updated to reflect actual developments as necessary.  \\nImpact of the macroeconomic environment and climate-related \\naspects on accounting in the reporting period \\nBased on available information, the effects of the current macroe-\\nconomic environment on the accounting of the Continental Group \\nwere also continuously reviewed over the course of 2024. The \\nmacroeconomic environment was shaped in particular by persis-\\ntently high inflation and high interest rates in the reporting period. \\nThe analysis of the effects of the macroeconomic environment on \\nthe accounting of the Continental Group included in particular the \\nimpairment testing of non-financial assets, the review of actuarial \\nassumptions used to measure employee benefits and the review of \\nthe measurement of financial instruments and revenue from \\ncontracts with customers. This had no material effect on the report-\\ning of the Continental Group in the reporting period. Overall, as in \\nthe previous year, there was a high level of uncertainty when mak-\\ning estimates in the reporting year. \\nWe continued to review whether climate-related issues had a signif-\\nicant effect on reporting in the year under review. Such effects are \\npossible in a number of different areas. Climate-related aspects can \\naffect, for example, the recoverability of non-financial assets and in-\\nventories, the useful life and residual carrying values of assets, the \\nexpected credit losses of financial instruments, the input factors \\nand assumptions used to measure value in use and fair value (e.g. \\ndiscount rates, point in time and amount of projected cash flows), \\ndeferred tax assets, legal and de facto obligations (provisions and \\ncontingent liabilities), financial risk management (market risk, liquid-\\nity risk and default risk as well as risk concentration), and the finan-\\ncial accounting of participation in emissions trading systems and of \\nenergy supply agreements. \\nClimate-related risk factors were therefore considered in estimates and \\njudgments when preparing the consolidated financial statements. \\nClimate-related aspects are also considered in the management re-\\nmuneration structure. As described in the remuneration report, the \\nlong-term incentive (LTI) for the Executive Board members within \\nthe framework of the remuneration system in place until Decem-\\nber 31, 2023 (remuneration system prior to December 31, 2023) \\nincludes a sustainability factor as a second performance criterion  \\nin addition to the degree of target achievement of the relative total \\nshareholder return (TSR). To determine the LTI to be paid out, this \\nsustainability factor is multiplied as a factor between 0.7 and 1.3 by \\nthe degree of target achievement of the relative TSR. Each year, the \\nSupervisory Board set out up to six performance criteria and targets \\nfor the sustainability factor of the respective LTI plan. The structure \\nof the LTI was changed under the expanded remuneration system \\nvalid from January 1, 2024 (remuneration system as of January 1, \\n2024). The LTI now comprises three performance criteria, which \\nare additively linked together. The first financial performance crite-\\nrion is still the relative TSR with a weighting of 50%. Added to this \\nas a second financial performance criterion is the return on capital \\nemployed (ROCE) – calculated using the operating result adjusted \\nfor impairment on goodwill and divestments of companies and \\nbusiness operations – with a weighting of 30%. The third, non-finan-\\ncial performance criterion is environmental, social and governance \\n(ESG) indicators with a weighting of 20%. The Supervisory Board \\ngenerally sets between one and four ESG indicators each year be-\\nfore the term begins. The targets under the sustainability factor in \\nthe remuneration system prior to December 31, 2023, as well as \\nthe ESG indicators in the remuneration system as of October 1, \\n2024, are based on the Continental Group’s sustainability ambition \\nand its further development, the reported sustainability indicators \\nand associated corporate targets as well as management pro-\\ncesses, which are specified in detail in the sustainability report as a \\nseparate section of the management report. The target values for \\nthe individual target years of the LTI are derived from the medium \\nand long-term corporate targets. For own CO2 emissions, for exam-\\nple, the target path of the 2035 climate target and the correspond-\\ning intermediate steps for the respective LTI target values are used. \\nThe term of the LTI is set at four years in both remuneration systems. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n258\\nIn the remuneration system prior to December 31, 2023, the basis \\nfor measuring the target achievement is the measurement of per-\\nformance in the corresponding period or in the last year of the \\nplan. In the remuneration system as of January 1, 2024, a three-\\nyear performance period is specified for the performance criteria. \\nAt the end of the four-year term, the share price performance over \\nthe term of the plan is considered. For own CO2 emissions, the stra-\\ntegic orientation for the defined target values, where necessary \\nwith interim steps for the individual tranches in order to achieve \\nthe long-term goal, is to reduce own CO2 emissions to 0.5 million \\nmetric tons of CO2 by 2035. This indicator is included in the 2020–\\n2023, 2021–2024, 2022–2025 and 2023–2026 LTI plans as a tar-\\nget criterion in the sustainability factor and in the 2024–2027 LTI \\nplan as an ESG indicator. \\nAs in previous years, no significant effects of climate-related risk \\nfactors on reporting were identified. There were also no significant \\neffects on individual items in the reporting period.  \\nImpact of the geopolitical situation on accounting in the \\nreporting period \\nBased on available information during the reporting period, Conti-\\nnental continuously reviewed the effects of the ongoing war in \\nUkraine, the conflict in the Middle East, the conflict between China \\nand Taiwan and the unclear development of the geopolitical situa-\\ntion as well as the resulting disruptions to production, supply chains \\nand demand, on the accounting of the Continental Group. This re-\\nview had no material effect on the reporting of the Continental \\nGroup in the reporting period or as at December 31, 2024.  \\nWith respect to further developments concerning the geopolitical \\nsituation, climate-related aspects and the macroeconomic environ-\\nment, the Continental Group is still continuously reviewing the pos-\\nsible effects on accounting. \\nConsolidated statement of cash flows \\nThe statement of cash flows shows the sources during the report-\\ning period that generated cash and cash equivalents as well as the \\napplication of cash and cash equivalents. This includes all cash and \\ncash equivalents and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-\\nterm, highly liquid financial investments that can be readily con-\\nverted into known cash amounts and are subject to an insignificant \\nrisk of changes in value.  \\nThe restrictions that may impact the availability of capital are also \\nunderstood to comprise all existing restrictions on the cash and \\ncash equivalents. In the Continental Group, the cash and cash \\nequivalents are restricted with regard to pledged amounts and bal-\\nances in countries with foreign-exchange restrictions or other barri-\\ners to accessing liquidity. Taxes to be paid on the transfer of cash \\nassets from one country to another are not usually considered to \\nrepresent a restriction on cash and cash equivalents. \\nFinancial investments are considered to be cash equivalents only if \\nthey have a remaining original term not exceeding three months. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n259\\n3. New Accounting Pronouncements \\nIn accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 in con-\\njunction with Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code \\n(Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB), Continental AG has prepared its con-\\nsolidated financial statements in compliance with IFRS as adopted \\nby the Commission of the European Communities under the Euro-\\npean Union endorsement procedure. Accordingly, IFRS are only re-\\nquired to be applied following endorsement of the new standards \\nby the European Commission. \\nThe following endorsed standards, interpretations issued in \\nrelation to published standards and amendments that were \\napplicable to the consolidated financial statements of \\nContinental AG became effective in 2024 and have been \\nadopted accordingly: \\nThe amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements \\n(Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current), in 2020  \\nclarify the classification of a liability. For a liability to be classified as \\nnon-current, the entity’s substantial right to defer settlement of the \\nliability for at least 12 months after the reporting period must exist \\nat the end of the reporting period. For a liability to be non-current, \\nan assessment is required of whether an entity has the right to de-\\nfer settlement of a liability and not whether the entity will exercise \\nthat right. Furthermore, the amendments clarify the circumstances \\nin which counterparty conversion options in relation to issued  \\nequity instruments affect classification as current or non-current. \\nThe 2020 amendments also specified how an entity should assess \\nwhether it has the right to defer settlement of a liability when that \\nright is subject to compliance with specified conditions (covenants) \\nwithin 12 months after the reporting period. Due to strong concerns \\nabout its interpretation, the IASB addressed this point and made im-\\nprovements in further amendments to IAS 1 in 2022. These further \\namendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements (Non-\\ncurrent Liabilities with Covenants), in 2022 clarify that covenants to \\nbe complied with after the reporting period do not affect the classi-\\nfication of the corresponding liability as current or non-current at \\nthe end of the reporting period. Instead, the amendments require \\nan entity to disclose information about these covenants in the \\nnotes to the financial statements. The amendments to IAS 1, \\nPresentation of Financial Statements (Classification of Liabilities  \\nas Current or Non-current), in 2020 were originally required to be \\napplied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. \\nThe additional amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial State-\\nments (Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Defer-\\nral of Effective Date), in July 2020 deferred the effective date of the \\namendments by one year to annual reporting periods beginning on \\nor after January 1, 2023, as operational relief due to the COVID-19 \\npandemic. With the further amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of \\nFinancial Statements (Non-current Liabilities with Covenants), in \\n2022, all amendments to IAS 1 together are required to be applied \\nfor annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The de-\\ntailed effects on the consolidated financial statements of Continen-\\ntal AG are presented in Note 31 under “Effects of the first-time \\nadoption of the amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial \\nStatements.” \\nThe amendments to IFRS 16, Leases (Lease Liability in a Sale and \\nLeaseback), refine the accounting treatment for sale and leaseback \\ntransactions. The amendments specify the requirements that a seller-\\nlessee should apply when measuring the lease liability arising from a \\nsale and leaseback transaction, to ensure that the seller-lessee does \\nnot recognize a gain or loss from the right of use retained. The \\namendments are required to be applied for annual periods beginning \\non or after January 1, 2024. The amendments had no significant  \\neffect on the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG.  \\nThe amendments to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows, and IFRS 7,  \\nFinancial Instruments: Disclosures, (Supplier Finance Arrangements), \\nrequire an entity to provide additional disclosures about its supplier \\nfinance arrangements that enable users of financial statements to \\nassess the effects of those arrangements on the entity’s liabilities \\nand cash flows and on the entity’s exposure to liquidity risk. The \\namendments are required to be applied for annual periods begin-\\nning on or after January 1, 2024. The amendments had no signifi-\\ncant effect on the consolidated financial statements of Continental \\nAG. The additional disclosures can be found in Notes 32 and 34. \\nThe following standards, interpretations issued in relation to \\npublished standards and amendments have already been \\nadopted by the EU but will not take effect until a later date: \\nThe amendments to IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign  \\nExchange Rates (Lack of Exchangeability), require an entity to apply \\na consistent approach to assessing whether a currency is exchange-\\nable into another currency and, when it is not, to determining the \\nexchange rate to use. A currency is exchangeable into another cur-\\nrency when an entity is able to obtain the other currency within a \\ntime frame that allows for a normal administrative delay and through \\na market or exchange mechanism in which an exchange transac-\\ntion would create enforceable rights and obligations. If an entity is \\nable to obtain no more than an insignificant amount of the other \\ncurrency at the measurement date for the specified purpose, the \\ncurrency is not exchangeable into the other currency. If a currency \\nis not exchangeable at the measurement date, an entity is required \\nto estimate a spot exchange rate (rate at which an orderly exchange \\ntransaction would take place at the measurement date between \\nmarket participants under prevailing economic conditions). In this \\ncase, the entity is required to disclose information that enables  \\nusers of its financial statements to understand how the lack of ex-\\nchangeability affects, or is expected to affect, the entity’s financial \\nperformance, financial position and cash flows. The amendments are \\nrequired to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after Jan-\\nuary 1, 2025. The amendments are not expected to have any sig-\\nnificant effect on the future consolidated financial statements of \\nContinental AG.  \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n260\\nThe following standards, interpretations issued in relation to \\npublished standards and amendments have not yet been \\nadopted by the EU and will become effective at a later date:  \\nIFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements, re-\\nplaces IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, while carrying \\nforward many of the requirements from IAS 1. IFRS 18 introduces \\nnew requirements regarding the presentation of specified catego-\\nries (operating category, investing category and financing cate-\\ngory) and defines subtotals in the income statement in order to \\nmake it easier to compare the financial performance of similar \\ncompanies. In addition, IFRS 18 requires disclosures on company-\\nspecific performance indicators that are not specified by IFRS Ac-\\ncounting Standards but have been defined by the company’s man-\\nagement (so-called management defined-performance measures, \\nor MPMs) to be provided in the notes. Furthermore, there may be \\nchanges to the information provided in the notes due to new ag-\\ngregation and disaggregation principles. Some of the requirements \\nin IAS 1 are moved to IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Ac-\\ncounting Estimates and Errors, and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: \\nDisclosures. IFRS 18 also amends IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows, \\nand IAS 33, Earnings per Share, to a minimal extent. The new stand-\\nard is required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or  \\nafter January 1, 2027. A project to implement the requirements of \\nIFRS 18 and the resulting changes in the Continental Group has \\nbeen initiated. The ongoing impact analysis does not yet allow a \\nconclusive statement to be made on the effects of the new stand-\\nard (and the corresponding consequential amendments to other \\nstandards and interpretations) on the future consolidated financial \\nstatements of Continental AG. The Continental Group currently ex-\\npects effects from the allocation of income and expense items to \\nthe new income statement categories. This will also affect the cal-\\nculation and presentation of the operating result. Changes to the \\nitems in the primary financial statements also cannot be ruled out \\ndue to the application of the useful structured summary concept \\nand new aggregation and disaggregation principles. New disclo-\\nsures in the notes are also required. There will be a change in the \\npresentation of interest paid and received in the statement of cash \\nflows.  \\nIFRS 19, Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures, per-\\nmits eligible subsidiaries to use IFRS Accounting Standards with re-\\nduced disclosures. Subsidiaries are eligible to apply the new stand-\\nard if they do not have public accountability and their parent com-\\npany applies IFRS Accounting Standards in its consolidated finan-\\ncial statements. A subsidiary does not have public accountability if \\nit does not have equities or debt listed on a stock exchange and \\ndoes not hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of \\noutsiders. IFRS 19 is required to be applied for annual periods be-\\nginning on or after January 1, 2027. The standard is not expected \\nto have any effect on the future consolidated financial statements \\nof Continental AG. \\nThe amendments to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and IFRS 7, Fi-\\nnancial Instruments: Disclosures, (Amendments to the Classification \\nand Measurement of Financial Instruments), refine the classification, \\nmeasurement and disclosure of financial assets and financial liabili-\\nties. The amendments clarify and extend the application guidance \\nfor assessing whether a financial asset meets the cash flow crite-\\nrion (SPPI criterion). This includes both the classification of financial \\nassets with ESG-linked (environmental, social and governance) or \\nsimilar features, as well as the classification of financial assets with \\nnon-recourse features and contractually linked instruments. The \\namendments include clarifications on the timing of recognition and \\nderecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. In principle, \\nfinancial liabilities are to be derecognized on the settlement date. \\nWith regard to the derecognition of financial liabilities settled using \\nelectronic payment systems, the amendments introduce an option \\nthat permits the financial liability to be discharged before the settle-\\nment date if certain criteria are met. Furthermore, the amendments \\nintroduce additional disclosure requirements to enhance transpar-\\nency for investors regarding investments in equity instruments \\ndesignated at fair value through other comprehensive income and \\nfinancial instruments with contractual terms that could change the \\ntiming or amount of contractual cash flows. The amendments are \\nrequired to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after Jan-\\nuary 1, 2026. The amendments are not expected to have any sig-\\nnificant effect on the future consolidated financial statements of \\nContinental AG. \\nThe amendments to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, and IFRS 7,  \\nFinancial Instruments: Disclosures, (Contracts Referencing Nature-\\ndependent Electricity), clarify the accounting for contracts for nature-\\ndependent electricity supply that expose an entity to variability in \\nthe underlying amount of electricity because the source of electric-\\nity generation depends on uncontrollable natural conditions (for  \\nexample, the weather). Contracts referencing nature-dependent \\nelectricity include both contracts to buy or sell nature-dependent \\nelectricity and financial instruments that reference such electricity. \\nTo ensure that financial statements faithfully represent the effects \\nof an entity’s contracts referencing nature-dependent electricity, \\nthe amendments clarify the application of the “own-use” require-\\nments, permitting hedge accounting if these contracts are used as \\nhedging instruments. Furthermore, the amendments add new dis-\\nclosure requirements to enable investors to understand the effect \\nof these contracts on a company’s financial performance and cash \\nflows. The amendments are required to be applied for annual peri-\\nods beginning on or after January 1, 2026. The amendments are \\nnot expected to have any significant effect on the future consoli-\\ndated financial statements of Continental AG.  \\nUnder the IASB’s annual improvements project, Improvements to \\nIFRS Accounting Standards, July 2024, Volume 11, the following \\namendments will become effective at a later date: \\n› The amendments to IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International \\nFinancial Reporting Standards, amend IFRS 1 regarding the hedge \\naccounting by a first-time adopter to improve consistency with \\nthe requirements in IFRS 9, Financial Instruments. Furthermore, \\nthe amendments add cross-references to improve the under-\\nstandability of IFRS 1. \\n› The amendments to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, \\nchange the wording and update an obsolete reference in IFRS 7 \\nto provide consistency with IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement, \\nwith respect to the gain or loss on derecognition.  \\n› The amendments to the guidance on implementing IFRS 7, Finan-\\ncial Instruments: Disclosures, clarify that the guidance does not \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n261\\nnecessarily illustrate all the requirements of the provisions of IFRS \\n7 stated therein, nor does it create additional requirements. In ad-\\ndition, the wording of the illustrative example on credit risk is ad-\\njusted for better understanding. The amendment also results in \\nadjustments to IFRS 7 relating to the disclosure of the deferred \\ndifference between fair value and transaction price to provide \\nconsistency within IFRS 7 and with IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, \\nand IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement. \\n› The amendments to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, clarify the  \\nderecognition of lease liabilities. In the case that a lease liability is \\nextinguished in accordance with IFRS 9, the lessee is required to \\napply IFRS 9 and to recognize any resulting gains or losses in \\nprofit or loss. Regarding the transaction price, the reference to  \\nthe definition of transaction price is removed to reflect the fact \\nthat the transaction price may be defined differently under IFRS 9 \\nthan under IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  \\n› The amendments to IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, \\nremove an inconsistency regarding the determination of a de facto \\nagent within IFRS 10.  \\n› The amendments to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows, replace the \\nterm “cost method” with the term “at cost.” \\nThe amendments are required to be applied for annual periods  \\nbeginning on or after January 1, 2026. The amendments are not \\nexpected to have any significant effect on the future consolidated \\nfinancial statements of Continental AG. \\n \\n4. Companies Consolidated and Information on Subsidiaries and Investments \\nCompanies consolidated \\nIn addition to the parent company, the number of companies con-\\nsolidated includes 477 (PY: 457) domestic and foreign companies \\nthat Continental Aktiengesellschaft incorporates according to the \\nregulations of IFRS 10 or that are classified as joint arrangements \\nor associates. Of these, 380 (PY: 385) are fully consolidated and 97 \\n(PY: 72) are accounted for using the equity method.  \\nThe number of companies consolidated has increased by a total of \\n20 since the previous year. Seven new companies were founded \\nand two companies were acquired. The number of companies con-\\nsolidated decreased by five as a result of mergers. In addition, two \\ncompanies were sold and six companies were liquidated. One com-\\npany was deconsolidated. The number of companies consolidated \\nincreased by 25 due to a change in the consolidation method for \\nthese companies. \\nA total of 27 (PY: 29) companies whose assets and liabilities, ex-\\npenses and income – individually and combined – are not material \\nfor the earnings, financial and net assets position of the Continental \\nGroup are not included in consolidation. Twenty-six (PY: 28) of these \\nare affiliated companies, six (PY: six) of which are currently inactive. \\nOne (PY: one) further company not included in consolidation is a \\njoint venture. This unit is active. \\nFor one company, a loss of control meant that the consolidation \\nmethod was changed from the full consolidation to the equity \\nmethod. This resulted in an equity investment at fair value of €27 \\nmillion and income of €19 million, which was recognized under \\nother income. \\nFor another company, the consolidation method changed from an-\\nother investment to an equity-accounted investee due to the ability \\nof Continental AG to exert significant influence on the associated \\ncompany. The associated cumulative valuation effects stated in \\nother comprehensive income of €10 million was reclassified to  \\nrevenue reserves. \\nInformation on subsidiaries and investments \\nAs at December 31, 2024, non-controlling interests were not of  \\nsignificance to the Continental Group. There are no significant re-\\nstrictions in terms of access to or the use of assets of the Continen-\\ntal Group due to statutory, contractual or regulatory restrictions or \\nproperty rights of non-controlling interests.  \\ne.solutions GmbH, Ingolstadt, Germany, which has a 51% share of \\nvoting rights, and Carrel Grundstücksverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH \\n& Co. Vermietungs KG, Mainz, Germany, which has a 94% share of \\nvoting rights, are not fully consolidated as, under the companies’ \\nstatutes, these interests are not enough to direct the relevant activi-\\nties of these investments.  \\nEasyMile SAS, Toulouse, France, which has a 9.5% share of voting \\nrights, is classified as an associate, as significant influence can be \\nexerted on the basis of the company’s Articles of Incorporation.  \\nContinental AG consolidates 18 (PY: 18) structured entities. The \\nstructured entities within the Continental Group are essentially \\ncompanies that serve to finance investments. These structured  \\nentities are characterized, among other things, by limited activities \\nand a narrowly defined business purpose. Continental holds no vot-\\ning rights or investments in the fully consolidated structured enti-\\nties. However, Continental directs the business activities of these \\nentities on the basis of contractual rights. The shareholders there-\\nfore have no influence. Furthermore, Continental is also exposed  \\nto variable returns from these entities and can influence these by \\ndirecting business activities. There are no significant shares or \\nrights in non-consolidated structured entities. \\nFurther information on equity investments and an overview of the \\nGerman companies and partnerships that utilized the exemption \\nprovisions of Sections 264 (3) and 264b of the German Commer-\\ncial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB) can be found in Note 42.  \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n262\\n5.

The purchase price  \\nof around €0 million was paid in cash. The final purchase price allo-\\ncation resulted in a negative difference of €1 million, which was rec-\\nognized in profit or loss under other income. Other than this, there \\nwas no material effect on the earnings, financial and net assets  \\nposition of the Continental Group as at December 31, 2024. \\nIn the ContiTech segment, the final purchase price allocation for \\nthe acquisition of Printing Solutions Sweden Holding AB, Trelleborg, \\nSweden, in 2023 led to a reduction in the purchase price of €1 mil-\\nlion. The final purchase price allocation resulted in a reduction in \\ngoodwill of €1 million.

This \\ntook into account a corporate tax rate of 15.0% (PY: 15.0%), a soli-\\ndarity surcharge of 5.5% (PY: 5.5%) and a trade tax rate of 14.9% \\n(PY: 14.8%). \\nThe reduction in the tax expense from foreign tax rate differences \\nprimarily reflects the volume of activities in Asia and Eastern Europe. \\nAs in the previous year, foreign tax rate differences as well as incen-\\ntives and tax holidays had positive effects in the year under review. \\nThe tax rate was negatively impacted by non-cash allowances on \\ndeferred tax assets totaling €311 million (PY: €64 million), of which \\n€258 million (PY: €42 million) was for previous years. Furthermore, \\nas in the previous year, the tax rate was negatively affected by non-\\ndeductible expenses and non-imputable foreign withholding taxes. \\nThe increase compared with the previous year is due, among other \\nthings, to non-deductible operating expenses in connection with \\ndividend distributions from subsidiaries, which were made as a pre-\\nparatory measure for the planned spin-off of the Automotive and \\nContract Manufacturing segments. In the year under review, local \\nincome taxes of €122 million (PY: €46 million) were incurred with  \\na different tax base or from minimum tax regulations. This was \\nattributable to local income taxes in Hungary and the alternative \\nminimum tax in the USA and Romania. It also includes expenses of \\n€55 million in connection with the regulations governing a global \\nminimum corporate tax rate (Pillar Two Model Rules). This relates to \\nprovisions for future payment obligations at the level of Continental \\nAG as a partially owned parent entity (POPE) both for subsidiaries \\nabroad in whose countries no local minimum tax under Pillar Two \\nhas been introduced and for subsidiaries based in countries that \\nlevy local minimum taxes. \\nAs in the previous year, the utilization of incentives in Europe, Asia \\nand the USA as well as in Brazil and Mexico had a positive impact \\non the tax rate. \\nPrior-year taxes had a positive impact of €228 million in the report-\\ning year. These were largely attributable to Germany and related to \\nthe results of tax audits and revised tax returns. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n269\\nThe effects from the change in enacted tax rate relate to the re-\\nmeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to changes \\nin the law already taking effect with regard to future applicable tax \\nrates.  \\nIn the previous year, the “Other” item included tax burdens incurred \\nfrom internal restructuring.  \\n \\nThe following table shows the total income tax expense, also including the items reported under reserves recognized directly in equity: \\n€ millions \\nDec. 31, 2024 \\nDec. 31, 2023 \\nIncome tax expense (acc. to consolidated statement of income) \\n–689 \\n–424 \\nTax income on other comprehensive income \\n–57 \\n107 \\nRemeasurement of defined benefit plans \\n–51 \\n104 \\nRemeasurement of other financial investments \\n–2 \\n3 \\nInvestment in equity-accounted investees \\n— \\n0 \\nCurrency translation \\n–4 \\n–1 \\nTotal income tax expense \\n–746 \\n–317 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n270\\n13.

In particular, production \\ncapacity was increased in the Safety and Motion, User Experience, \\nArchitecture and Network Solutions, and Autonomous Mobility busi-\\nness areas. There were major additions related to the construction \\nof new manufacturing plants for electronic brake systems and inno-\\nvative display and operating solutions, as well as vehicle electronics \\nsuch as high-performance computers and radar and camera solu-\\ntions. Investments were made in the development of production \\nsites in Novi Sad, Serbia; and Kaunas, Lithuania. \\nIn the Tires segment, investments were made to optimize and ex-\\npand production capacity at existing plants in European best-cost \\nlocations and in the USA, China, Germany and Thailand. There were \\nmajor additions related to the expansion of the production site in \\nHefei, China. Quality assurance and cost-cutting measures were  \\nimplemented as well. \\nIn the ContiTech segment, investments were made to expand pro-\\nduction capacity in Germany, the USA, Mexico, China, Brazil, Roma-\\nnia and Hungary. There were major additions related to the expan-\\nsion of production capacity in selected growth markets for the In-\\ndustrial Solutions Americas, Surface Solutions, Original Equipment \\nSolutions and Industrial Solutions EMEA business areas. In addition, \\ninvestments were made in all business areas to optimize existing \\nproduction processes. \\nIn the Contract Manufacturing segment, the capital expenditure was \\nprimarily attributable to production equipment for the manufacture \\nof specific products and the implementation of new technologies.  \\nThe addition to property, plant and equipment from changes in the \\nscope of consolidation totaling €1 million resulted mainly from the \\nacquisition of EMT Púchov s.r.o., Puchov, Slovakia. The addition to \\nproperty, plant and equipment in the previous year amounting to \\n€57 million resulted mainly from the acquisition of Printing Solutions \\nSweden Holding AB, Trelleborg, Sweden. \\nImpairment on property, plant and equipment resulted in expenses \\ntotaling €36 million (PY: €49 million), of which €36 million (PY: €30 \\nmillion) was attributable to the functional area of cost of sales and \\naround €0 million (PY: €19 million) to administrative expenses.

As a rule, the Conti-\\nnental Group endeavors to include extension and termination options \\nin new leases in order to ensure operational flexibility. For the initial \\nmeasurement of lease liabilities, such options are recognized once \\nit is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. If a significant \\nevent or a significant change in circumstances occurs that is within \\nContinental’s control, this will be taken into account accordingly in \\nthe remeasurement of lease liabilities. As at the end of the report-\\ning period, potential future lease payments of €678 million (PY: \\n€751 million) from such options were not included in the measure-\\nment of lease liabilities. Potential future cash outflows of €77 mil-\\nlion (PY: €201 million) arising from variable lease payments were \\nlikewise not included in the measurement of lease liabilities as at \\nthe end of the reporting period.

In connection with contract manufacturing, the \\nContinental Group expects future cash outflows from variable lease \\npayments of €48 million (PY: €201 million) for the remaining lease \\nterms. \\nContinental Group as lessor \\nThe Continental Group acts as lessor in some business relationships. \\nThese constitute operating leases as well as finance leases. Whereas \\nfor operating leases the Continental Group retains the material risks \\nand rewards incidental to ownership, for finance leases these are \\ntransferred to the lessee.  \\nOperating leases \\nLease income from operating leases in which the Continental Group \\nacts as lessor amounted to €4 million (PY: €3 million).

Given that future taxable in-\\ncome is expected, it is sufficiently probable that these deferred tax \\nassets can be realized. This is to be achieved in particular through \\nmeasures to optimize costs and increase efficiency in the Automo-\\ntive segment, the expansion of production capacities in high-growth \\nregions in the Tires segment, the continued strategic focus on in-\\ndustrial business in the ContiTech segment and the use of tax plan-\\nning opportunities. \\nThe temporary differences from retained earnings of foreign com-\\npanies amounted to a total of €965 million (PY: €1,117 million).

The increase in retained earnings is mainly due to pre-\\nparatory measures for the planned spin-off of the Automotive and \\nContract Manufacturing segments. The Supervisory Board and Ex-\\necutive Board will propose to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting the \\npayment of a dividend of €2.50 per share entitled to dividends.

Capital Management  \\nThe aim of the Continental Group is to maintain a strong capital \\nbase in order to preserve the trust of the capital market, customers \\nand employees and to ensure the sustainable development of the \\ncompany. To assess the achievement of these goals, the Continen-\\ntal Group uses the equity ratio (defined as equity reported in the \\nstatement of financial position, including non-controlling interests, \\ndivided by total assets) and the gearing ratio as key figures. The \\ngearing ratio is calculated as net indebtedness (corresponding to \\nthe amount of interest-bearing financial liabilities, the fair values of \\nderivative instruments, cash and cash equivalents, and other \\ninterest-bearing investments) divided by equity (as disclosed in the \\nstatement of financial position, including non-controlling interests). \\nIn general, the gearing ratio should be below 40% in the coming \\nyears. If justified by extraordinary financing reasons or specific mar-\\nket circumstances, we can rise above this ratio under certain condi-\\ntions. The equity ratio should exceed 30%. The overall strategy of \\nthe Continental Group remained unchanged from the previous \\nyear. The Continental Group is not subject to any externally im-\\nposed capital requirements, and its main loan agreements do not \\ncurrently contain any financial covenants. \\n \\nThe above key figures and parameters as at the reporting date were as follows: \\n€ millions \\nDec. 31, 2024 \\nDec. 31, 2023 \\nTotal equity \\n14,798 \\n14,125 \\nTotal assets \\n36,966 \\n37,753 \\nEquity ratio in % \\n40.0 \\n37.4 \\nLong-term indebtedness1 \\n4,112 \\n4,528 \\nShort-term indebtedness1 \\n2,797 \\n2,642 \\nLong-term derivative instruments and interest-bearing investments \\n–81 \\n–89 \\nShort-term derivative instruments and interest-bearing investments \\n–151 \\n–120 \\nCash and cash equivalents \\n–2,966 \\n–2,923 \\nNet indebtedness \\n3,712 \\n4,038 \\nGearing ratio in % \\n25.1 \\n28.6 \\n \\n \\n \\n1 Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, clarify the classification of current and non-current liabilities from the 2024 reporting year onward.

As a result of the significant increase in \\nthe number of employees in recent years and the high level of ac-\\nquisition activity, pension obligations essentially relate to active \\nemployees. The defined benefit pension plans cover 162,350 ben-\\neficiaries, including 106,964 active employees, 26,891 former em-\\nployees with vested benefits, and 28,495 retirees and surviving \\ndependents. The pension obligations are concentrated in four \\ncountries: Germany, the USA, the United Kingdom and Canada, \\nwhich account for more than 90% of total pension obligations. \\nThe weighted average term of the defined benefit pension obliga-\\ntions is around 16 years. This term is based on the present value \\nof the obligations. \\nGermany \\nIn Germany, Continental provides pension benefits through the \\ncash balance plan, prior commitments and deferred compensation.  \\nThe retirement plan regulation applicable to active members is \\nbased primarily on the cash balance plan and thus on benefit \\nmodules. When the insured event occurs, the retirement plan as-\\nsets are paid out as a lump-sum benefit, in installments or as a \\npension, depending on the amount of the retirement plan assets. \\nThere are no material minimum guarantees in relation to a particu-\\nlar amount of retirement benefits. \\nPension plans transferred to or assumed by Continental in the con-\\ntext of acquisitions (Siemens VDO, Temic, Teves, Phoenix) were in-\\ncluded in the cash balance plan. For the main German companies, \\nthe cash balance plan is partly covered by funds in contractual \\ntrust arrangements (CTAs). In Germany, there are no legal or regu-\\nlatory minimum funding requirements. \\nThe CTAs are legally independent from the company and manage \\nthe plan assets as trustees in accordance with the respective CTAs. \\nSome prior commitments were granted through two legally inde-\\npendent pension contribution funds. Pensionskasse für Angestellte \\nder Continental Aktiengesellschaft VVaG and Pensionskasse von \\n1925 der Phoenix AG VVaG have been closed since March 1, 1984, \\nand July 1, 1983, respectively. The pension contribution funds are \\nsmaller associations within the meaning of Section 53 of the Ger-\\nman Insurance Supervision Act (Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz – \\nVAG) and are subject to the supervision of the German Federal  \\nFinancial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienst-\\nleistungsaufsicht). The investment regulations are in accordance \\nwith the legal requirements and risk structure of the obligations. \\nThe pension contribution funds have tariffs with an interest rate  \\nof 2.5% or 2.25%. Under the German Company Pensions Law \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n290\\n(Betriebsrentengesetz – BetrAVG), Continental is ultimately liable \\nfor the implementation path of the pension contribution fund. In \\naccordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, the pension obliga-\\ntions covered by the pension contribution fund are therefore de-\\nfined benefit pension plans. The pension contribution funds met \\ntheir minimum net funding requirement as at December 31, 2024. \\nHowever, given that only the plan members are entitled to the as-\\nsets and amounts generated, the benefit obligations are recog-\\nnized in the same amount as the existing assets at fair value.  \\nContinental also supports private contribution through deferred \\ncompensation schemes.  \\nDeferred compensation is essentially offered through a fully \\nfunded multi-employer plan (Höchster Pensionskasse VVaG) for \\ncontributions up to 4% of the assessment ceiling in social security. \\nThe pension contribution fund ensures guaranteed minimum inter-\\nest for which Continental is ultimately liable under the German \\nCompany Pensions Law. The company is not liable for guarantees \\nto employees of other companies. As Höchster Pensionskasse \\nVVaG is a combined defined benefit plan for several companies \\nand Continental has no right to the information required for ac-\\ncounting for this defined benefit plan, this plan is recognized as a \\ndefined contribution plan. \\nEntitled employees can use the cash balance plan for deferred \\ncompensation contributions above the 4% assessment ceiling. \\nThis share is funded by insurance annuity contracts. \\nUSA \\nOwing to its acquisition history, Continental has various defined \\nbenefit plans in the USA, which were closed to new entrants and \\nfrozen to accretion of further benefits in a period from April 1, \\n2005, to December 31, 2011. In 2017, acquisitions also included \\nan open defined benefit plan for unionized employees. \\nThe closed defined benefit plans are commitments on the basis of \\nthe average final salary and cash balance commitments. The de-\\nfined benefit plans for unionized and non-unionized employees are \\nbased on a pension multiplier per year of service.  \\nClosed defined benefit plans were replaced by defined contribu-\\ntion plans. Defined contribution plans apply to the majority of  \\nactive employees in the USA. \\nDue to the sound financing status and possible split-up of the Con-\\ntinental Group, efforts are currently being made to push for addi-\\ntional funding. \\nThe plan assets of the defined benefit plans are managed in a  \\nmaster trust. Investment supervision was delegated to the Pension \\nCommittee, a body appointed within the Continental Group. The  \\nlegal and regulatory framework for the plans is based on the US \\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  \\nThe valuation of the financing level is required on the basis of this \\nlaw. The interest rate used for this calculation is the average rate \\nover a period of 25 years and therefore currently higher than the \\ninterest rate used to discount obligations under IAS 19. The statu-\\ntory valuation therefore gives rise to a lower obligation than that in \\nline with IAS 19. There is a regulatory requirement to ensure mini-\\nmum funding of 80% in the defined benefit plans to prevent bene-\\nfit curtailments. \\nUnited Kingdom \\nContinental maintains four defined benefit plans as a result of its \\nhistory of acquisitions in the United Kingdom. All plans are com-\\nmitments on the basis of the average or final salary. The four plans \\nwere closed to new employees in the period between April 1, 2002, \\nand November 30, 2004. Continental offers defined contribution \\nplans for all employees who have joined the company since that \\ntime.  \\nAs at April 5, 2016, the Continental Group Pension and Life Assur-\\nance Scheme was frozen to accretion of further benefits. It was  \\nreplaced by a defined contribution plan as at April 6, 2016. \\nAs at July 31, 2017, the Mannesmann UK Pension Scheme was \\nfrozen to accretion of further benefits. It was replaced by a defined \\ncontribution plan as at August 1, 2017. \\nOur pension strategy in the UK focuses on reducing risks and in-\\ncludes the option of partial or complete funding by purchasing an-\\nnuities. The rise in interest rates and the good funded status cur-\\nrently present opportunities to push for partial or complete fund-\\ning. The receptivity of the insurance market is currently limited. \\nThe funding conditions are defined by the UK Pensions Regulator \\nand the corresponding laws and regulations. The defined benefit \\nplans are managed by trust companies. The boards of trustees of \\nthese companies have an obligation solely to the good of the ben-\\neficiaries on the basis of the trust agreement and the law.  \\nThe necessary funding is determined every three years through \\ntechnical valuations in line with local provisions. The obligations \\nare measured using a discount rate based on government bonds \\nand other conservatively selected actuarial assumptions.  \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n291\\nCompared with IAS 19, which derives the discount rate from senior \\ncorporate bonds, this usually results in a higher obligation. Three of \\nthe four defined benefit plans had a funding deficit on the basis of \\nthe most recent technical valuation. The trustees and the company \\nhave agreed on a recovery plan that provides for additional tempo-\\nrary annual payments. The valuation process must be completed \\nwithin 15 months of the valuation date.  \\nThe most recent technical valuations of the four defined benefit \\npension plans took place with their valuation dates between De-\\ncember 2020 and March 2022 and led to the following result: \\n› Continental Teves UK Employee Benefit Scheme (assessment as \\nat December 31, 2020): Due to the extraordinary allocation in \\n2021 of GBP 10.0 million and the scheduled payment of GBP \\n1.4 million in October 2021, there is no need for a recovery plan \\nand therefore no further allocations are currently envisaged. The \\nassessment as at December 31, 2023, is currently undergoing  \\nfinal coordination, and the statutory deadline for finalization is \\nMarch 31, 2025. Due to the sound financing status, there is still \\nno expectation that a recovery plan will be necessary. \\n› Continental Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme: An \\nagreement was concluded with an insurer in 2019 for a com-\\nplete buy-out through the acquisition of annuities. The necessary \\ndata clarifications progressed in 2024 but have not yet been  \\nfinalized. Completion is now expected in 2025 at the earliest.  \\n› Mannesmann UK Pension Scheme (assessment as at March 31, \\n2022): As part of the assessment, an agreement was resolved on \\na monthly minimum endowment of GBP 175,000 until March \\n31, 2023, and a minimum monthly endowment of GBP 200,000 \\nfor the period from April 1, 2023, to August 31, 2026.  \\n› Phoenix Dunlop Oil & Marine Pension Scheme (assessment as at \\nDecember 31, 2021): As part of the assessment, an agreement \\nwas resolved on a minimum annual endowment of GBP 1.5 mil-\\nlion and an annual adjustment of 3.5% over a period from April 1, \\n2023, to March 2028. \\nCanada \\nContinental maintains various defined benefit plans as a result of \\nits history of acquisitions. The pension plans are based mainly on  \\na pension multiplier per year of service.  \\nFluctuations in the amount of the pension obligation resulting \\nfrom exchange-rate effects are subject to the same risks as overall \\nbusiness development. These fluctuations relate mainly to the cur-\\nrencies of the USA, Canada and the UK and have no material im-\\npact on Continental.

For this reason, the net periodic pen-\\nsion cost derived from the pension obligations does not change by \\nthe same amount as a result of an increase or decrease in the actu-\\narial assumptions.  \\nIn addition to the aforementioned sensitivities, the impact of a one-\\nyear-longer life expectancy on the value of benefit obligations was \\ncomputed for the key countries. A one-year increase in life expec-\\ntancy would lead to a €166 million (PY: €172 million) increase in \\nthe value of the benefit obligations, and that figure would be bro-\\nken down as follows: Germany €133 million (PY: €139 million), USA \\n€24 million (PY: €24 million), United Kingdom €8 million (PY: €9 \\nmillion) and Canada €1 million (PY: €1 million). In Germany, in-\\ncreased payments in the form of pensions rather than capital were \\nassumed in the actuarial valuation, which has the effect of increas-\\ning the benefit obligations. For the calculation of pension obliga-\\ntions for domestic plans, life expectancy is based on the 2018 G \\nmortality tables by Prof. Klaus Heubeck. For foreign pension plans, \\ncomparable criteria are used for the respective country. \\nPlan assets \\nThe structure of the Continental Group’s plan assets is reviewed by \\nthe investment committees on an ongoing basis taking into account \\nthe forecast pension obligations.

These entitlements are paid out when the employment \\nrelationship is terminated. In the year under review, expenses from \\nthese obligations amounted to €15 million (PY: €5 million). \\nDefined contribution pension plans \\nThe Continental Group offers its employees pension plans in the \\nform of defined contribution plans, particularly in the USA, the UK, \\nJapan and China. Not including social security contributions, ex-\\npenses from defined contribution pension plans amounted to €76 \\nmillion (PY: €81 million) in the fiscal year. \\nOther employee benefits \\nOther employee benefits include provisions for partial early retire-\\nment programs and anniversary and other long-service benefits. \\nThe provisions for partial early retirement are calculated using a \\ndiscount rate of 2.75% (PY: 3.53%). Provisions for anniversary and \\nother long-service benefits are calculated using a discount rate of \\n3.34% (PY: 3.20%). In accordance with the option under IAS 19, \\nEmployee Benefits, the interest component is reported in the finan-\\ncial result.  \\nVariable remuneration elements \\nLiabilities for payroll and personnel-related costs also include varia-\\nble components based on performance. The variable components \\nthat are based on performance comprise a short-term remunera-\\ntion component (performance bonus without equity deferral) as \\nwell as long-term remuneration components (long-term incentive \\nand equity deferral of the performance bonus). \\nThe LTI plans are classified as cash-settled share-based payments; \\nhence they are recognized at fair value in accordance with IFRS 2, \\nShare-based Payment. The equity deferral of the performance bo-\\nnus of the remuneration system applicable from 2020 is classified \\nas an equity-settled share-based payment; hence it is recognized at \\nfair value in accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based Payment. \\nLong-term incentive plans (LTI plans) \\nExpenses of €27 million (PY: €54 million) from the addition of pro-\\nvisions for the 2021 to 2024 LTI plan were recognized in the re-\\nspective function costs. \\n› 2014 to 2019 LTI plan: From 2014 to 2019, senior executives of \\nthe Continental Group and members of the Executive Board were \\ngranted an LTI bonus. This bonus was intended to allow for partic-\\nipation in the long-term, sustainable increase in the Continental \\nGroup’s value and profitability. The LTI bonus depended on job \\ngrade and degree of target achievement and was issued in an-\\nnual tranches. \\n› The term of the 2019/22 tranche, which was resolved on March \\n14, 2019, by the Supervisory Board for the members of the Exec-\\nutive Board and on May 24, 2019, by the Executive Board for \\nsenior executives, begins retroactively as at January 1, 2019, and \\nis four years. After the expiry of the 2019/22 LTI tranche in De-\\ncember 2022, the bonus was not paid out in 2023, as the fair \\nvalue of the tranche as at the payment date was around €0 mil-\\nlion. \\nFor each beneficiary of an LTI tranche, the Supervisory Board (for \\nthe members of the Executive Board) or the Executive Board (for \\nsenior executives) of Continental AG specified the amount of a tar-\\nget bonus in euros to be paid out upon 100% target achievement. \\nThe actual LTI bonus paid out on expiry of the LTI tranche depends \\non the degree of target achievement. The LTI bonus can range be-\\ntween 0% (no payment) and 200% (maximum payment). \\nThe degree of achievement of two target criteria is decisive for the \\npayment and amount of the LTI bonus. The first target criterion is \\nthe equally weighted average of the Continental Value Contribution \\n(CVC) of the Continental Group over a period of four fiscal years, \\nstarting from the fiscal year in which the LTI tranche is issued. The \\nequally weighted average is calculated by adding together 25% of \\nthe CVC of the four fiscal years of the term of the LTI tranche. The \\nsecond target criterion is the total shareholder return (TSR) on Con-\\ntinental shares as at the end of the term in relation to the beginning \\nof the LTI tranche. The share price used in calculating the TSR is \\nthe arithmetic mean of closing prices in Xetra trading on the Frank-\\nfurt Stock Exchange (or a successor system) on the trading days in \\nthe three months from October to December before the issue and \\nexpiry of the LTI tranche. In addition, all dividends paid during the \\nterm of the LTI tranche are taken into account for the TSR.  \\nThe scale for determining the degree of target achievement is de-\\nfined by the Supervisory Board or the Executive Board when the re-\\nspective LTI tranche is issued. This key data is identical for the \\nmembers of the Executive Board and senior executives. The degree \\nof target achievement for the first target criterion can lie between \\n0% and 200%. Target achievement is calculated on a straight-line \\nbasis between 0% and the maximum amount. There is no cap for \\nthe second target criterion. The ultimate degree of target achieve-\\nment used to calculate the LTI bonus to be paid out is determined \\nby multiplying the two target criteria. The LTI bonus to be paid out \\nis determined by multiplying the degree of target achievement by \\nthe target bonus. The total maximum achievable LTI bonus is 200% \\nof the target bonus. \\nA Monte Carlo simulation is used in the measurement of the TSR \\ntarget criterion. This means that log-normal distributed processes \\nare simulated for the price of Continental shares. The Monte Carlo \\nsimulation takes into account the average value accumulation of \\nshare prices in the respective reference period, the TSR dividends \\nand the restriction for the payment amount.  \\n› 2020 to 2023 LTI plan: From 2020, a new LTI plan was granted \\nto the Executive Board, senior executives and executives that \\naims to promote long-term commitment to the company and its \\nsustainable growth. Therefore, the long-term TSR of Continental \\nshares, compared with an index consisting of European compa-\\nnies that are active in the automotive and tire industry and com-\\nparable with Continental AG (STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & \\nParts (SXAGR); hereinafter “benchmark index”), is a key perfor-\\nmance criterion for the LTI. The second performance criterion is a \\nsustainability factor that is multiplied by the degree of target \\nachievement in order to calculate the LTI to be paid. The amount \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n301\\nof the LTI to be paid is based on the performance of the Conti-\\nnental share price over the term of the LTI. \\n› The term of the 2020 LTI plan, which was resolved on March 17, \\n2020, by the Supervisory Board for the members of the Execu-\\ntive Board, and on March 2, 2020, by the Executive Board for \\nsenior executives and executives, begins retroactively as at Janu-\\nary 1, 2020, and is four years for the Executive Board and three \\nyears for senior executives and executives. After the expiry of the \\n2020 LTI plan in December 2022, the bonus for executives and \\nsenior executives was paid out in 2023. After the expiry of the \\n2020 LTI plan in December 2023, the bonus for the Executive \\nBoard was paid out in 2024. \\n› The term of the 2021 LTI plan, which was resolved on December \\n15, 2020, by the Supervisory Board for the members of the Exec-\\nutive Board, and on March 22, 2021, by the Executive Board for \\nsenior executives and executives, begins retroactively as at Janu-\\nary 1, 2021, and is four years for the Executive Board and three \\nyears for senior executives and executives.

The \\nbasic holding is multiplied by a performance index (PI) in order to \\ndetermine the final holding of virtual shares. The performance in-\\ndex corresponds to the product from the relative total shareholder \\nreturn (TSR) on Continental shares and a sustainability factor. The \\nrelative TSR is calculated from the relative performance of the Con-\\ntinental TSR in comparison with the TSR on the STOXX Europe 600 \\nAutomobiles & Parts (SXAGR). The Continental TSR corresponds to \\nthe sum of the average Continental share price in the last month of \\nthe term (final share price) and all dividends distributed during the \\nterm relative to the average share price in the first month of the \\nterm (initial share price). The SXAGR TSR is determined using the \\nsame method. \\nPerformance criteria and goals of the sustainability factor are tar-\\ngets for CO2 emissions, recycling quotas and the ensuring of good \\nworking conditions for employees in the Continental Group (e.g. \\nbased on sick leave, accident rates and employee satisfaction).  \\nThe payment amount of the 2020 to 2023 LTI plan can total at \\nmost 200% of the defined initial share price (executives and senior \\nexecutives) or issue price (Executive Board). The issue price is the \\naverage price of the two months before the start of the term.  \\nThe final holding of virtual shares is multiplied by the payout price \\nin order to determine the gross amount of the LTI to be paid out in \\neuros (hereinafter “payout amount”). The payout price is the sum of \\nthe arithmetic mean of Continental AG’s closing share prices in \\nXetra trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (or a successor sys-\\ntem) on the trading days in the last two months prior to the next \\nordinary Annual Shareholders’ Meeting that follows the end of the \\nterm of the LTI plan and the dividends paid out per share during \\nthe term of the LTI plan. \\nA Monte Carlo simulation is used in the measurement of stock op-\\ntions. This means that log-normal distributed processes are simu-\\nlated for the price of Continental shares and the price of the STOXX \\nEurope 600 Automobiles & Parts (benchmark index). The Monte \\nCarlo simulation takes into account the average value accumula-\\ntion of the Continental share prices and the benchmark index for \\nthe final share price and the payout price, the TSR dividends, the \\nperformance compared with the benchmark index and the re-\\nstriction for the payment amount. \\n› 2024 LTI plan: From 2024, a new LTI plan was granted to the Ex-\\necutive Board, senior executives and executives that aims to pro-\\nmote long-term commitment to the company and its sustainable \\ngrowth. Therefore, the long-term TSR of Continental shares, com-\\npared with an index consisting of European companies that are \\nactive in the automotive and tire industry and comparable with \\nContinental AG (STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts (SXAGR); \\nhereinafter “benchmark index”), is a key performance criterion for \\nthe LTI. The second performance criterion is the return on capital \\nemployed (ROCE) determined based on the ratio of EBIT – adjusted \\nfor impairment on goodwill and divestments of companies and \\nbusiness operations – to average operating assets. The third per-\\nformance criterion is a sustainability factor that includes three \\nequally weighted sustainability targets. The amount of the LTI to \\nbe paid is based on the performance of the Continental share \\nprice over the term of the LTI. \\n› The term of the 2024 LTI plan, which was resolved on December \\n13, 2023, by the Supervisory Board for the members of the Exec-\\nutive Board, and on March 8, 2024, by the Executive Board for \\nsenior executives and executives, begins retroactively as at Janu-\\nary 1, 2024, and is four years for the Executive Board and three \\nyears for senior executives and executives. \\n› For each beneficiary of the 2024 LTI plan, the Supervisory Board \\n(for the members of the Executive Board) or the Executive Board \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n302\\n(for senior executives and executives) of Continental AG agrees \\nan allotment value in euros for the LTI.  \\nAt the start of the first fiscal year of the term of the LTI plan, this al-\\nlotment value is converted into a basic holding of virtual shares. \\nThe allotment value is divided by the arithmetic mean of Continen-\\ntal AG’s closing share prices in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt Stock \\nExchange (or a successor system) in the last two months prior to \\nthe start of the term of the respective LTI plan (issue price). The \\nbasic holding is multiplied by a performance index (PI) in order to \\ndetermine the final holding of virtual shares. The performance in-\\ndex corresponds to the weighted sum of the relative total share-\\nholder return (TSR) on Continental shares (50%), the ROCE (30%) \\nand a sustainability criterion (20%). The relative TSR is calculated \\nfrom the relative performance of the Continental TSR in compari-\\nson with the TSR on the STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts \\n(SXAGR). The Continental TSR corresponds to the sum of the aver-\\nage Continental share price in the last quarter of the term (senior \\nexecutives and executives) or in the last month of the performance \\nperiod (Executive Board) and all dividends distributed during the \\nperformance period relative to the share price in the first quarter of \\nthe term (senior executives and executives) or in the first month of \\nthe term (Executive Board). The SXAGR TSR is determined using \\nthe same method.  \\nThe ROCE is determined on the basis of the ratio of EBIT – adjusted \\nfor impairment on goodwill and divestments of companies and \\nbusiness operations – to average operating assets for the fiscal \\nyear. \\nPerformance criteria and goals of the sustainability criterion are  \\ntargets for CO2 emissions, recycling quotas and the review of good \\nworking conditions for employees in the Continental Group (e.g. \\nbased on sick leave, accident rates and employee satisfaction).  \\nThe final holding of virtual shares is multiplied by the payout price \\nin order to determine the gross amount of the LTI to be paid out in \\neuros (hereinafter “payout amount”). The payment amount of the \\n2024 LTI plan can total at most 200% of the average price in the \\nfirst quarter of the term (executives and senior executives) or in the \\nlast 30 trading days prior to the start of the term (Executive Board). \\nThe payout price is the average price in the last quarter of the term \\n(executives and senior executives) or in the final 30 trading days \\nbefore maturity (Executive Board), plus all dividends distributed per \\nshare during the term. \\nA Monte Carlo simulation is used in the measurement of stock op-\\ntions. This means that log-normal distributed processes are simu-\\nlated for the price of Continental shares and the price of the STOXX \\nEurope 600 Automobiles & Parts (benchmark index). The Monte \\nCarlo simulation takes into account the average value accumula-\\ntion of the Continental share prices and the benchmark index for \\nthe final share price and the payout price, the TSR dividends, the \\nperformance compared with the benchmark index and the re-\\nstriction for the payment amount. \\nThe following TSR parameters were used as at the measurement \\ndate of December 31, 2024: \\n› Constant zero rates as at the measurement date of December 31, \\n2024:  \\n› 2021 LTI plan (Executive Board): 2.35% as at the due date and \\n2.31% as at the end of the payout price period; \\n› 2022 LTI plan (senior executives and executives): 2.34% at the \\nend of the payout price period; \\n› 2022 LTI plan (Executive Board): 2.02% as at the due date and \\n1.99% as at the end of the payout price period; \\n› 2023 LTI plan (senior executives and executives): 2.10% as at \\nthe due date and 2.00% as at the end of the payout price period; \\n› 2023 LTI plan (Executive Board): 1.97% as at the due date and \\n1.97% as at the end of the payout price period; \\n› 2024 LTI plan (senior executives and executives): 1.97% as at \\nthe due date and 1.97% as at the end of the payout price period; \\n› 2024 LTI plan (Executive Board): 1.99% as at the due date and \\n2.00% as at the end of the payout price period. \\n› Continental share price at year-end of €64.82. \\n› Interest rate based on the yield curve for government bonds. \\n› Dividend payments as the arithmetic mean based on publicly \\navailable estimates for 2025 until 2027; the dividend of Conti-\\nnental AG amounted to €2.20 per share in 2024, and Continental \\nAG distributed a dividend of €1.50 per share in 2023. \\n› Historical volatilities on the basis of daily Xetra closing rates for \\nContinental shares and the benchmark index based on the re-\\nspective remaining term for LTI tranches and the 2021 to 2024 \\nLTI plan.

Under the Debt Issuance Programme (DIP), Continental AG \\nissued one listed euro bond on October 1, 2024, with an issue vol-\\nume of €600 million. The issue price of this bond, which has a term \\nof five years and a fixed interest rate of 3.500% p.a., was 99.946%. \\nThe €625-million euro bond of Conti-Gummi Finance B.V., Maastricht, \\nNetherlands, maturing on September 25, 2024, was redeemed in \\nthe second half of the year at a rate of 100.000%. This bond had \\nan interest rate of 1.125% p.a. and a term of four years and three \\nmonths.  \\nIn addition, on October 16, 2024, the private placement issued  \\nby Continental AG in October 2019 was redeemed at a rate of \\n100.000%. The private placement had a nominal volume of €100 \\nmillion, a term of five years and a fixed interest rate of 0.231% p.a. \\nCredit lines and available financing from banks \\nBank loans and overdrafts amounted to €1,042 million (PY: €1,386 \\nmillion) as at December 31, 2024, and were therefore €343 million \\nbelow the previous year’s level. On December 31, 2024, there were \\ncredit lines and available financing from banks in the amount of \\n€6,034 million (PY: €5,982 million). A nominal amount of €4,966 \\nmillion of this had not been utilized as at the end of the reporting \\nperiod (PY: €4,569 million). The syndicated loan of the Continental \\nGroup described below accounted for €4,000 million of this (PY: \\n€3,684 million). Besides this, the major portion of the credit lines \\nand available financing from banks related, as in the previous year, \\nto predominantly floating-rate short-term borrowings. \\nThe syndicated loan that was renewed ahead of schedule in De-\\ncember 2019 consists of a revolving tranche of €4,000 million and \\nhas an original term of five years. The margin will also depend on  \\nthe Continental Group’s sustainability performance. If the Continental \\nGroup achieves the performance improvements in sustainability as \\nset out in detail in the loan agreement, this will reduce the margin; \\nnon-achievement will result in a margin increase. The loan agreement \\ncontains no obligation to comply with financial covenants. Utilizations \\nmay be undertaken both in euros and US dollars on the basis of \\nvariable interest rates. Depending on the currency, interest is ac-\\ncrued at either the EURIBOR rate or the corresponding USD Se-\\ncured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), plus a margin in each case. \\nContinental has exercised two options, each extending the term of \\nthe loan by one year. This means that the financing commitment  \\nof the banks is now available until December 2026. This revolving \\nloan had not been utilized as at December 31, 2024 (PY: €316 mil-\\nlion utilized by Continental Rubber of America, Corp., Wilmington, \\nDelaware, USA).  \\nEffects of the first-time adoption of the amendments to IAS 1, \\nPresentation of Financial Statements  \\nThe amendments had the following effects on the 2024 consoli-\\ndated financial statements, the comparative period presented and \\nthe opening statement of financial position of the comparative pe-\\nriod: in accordance with the amendments to IAS 1 effective Decem-\\nber 31, 2024, utilizations of the syndicated loan should be recog-\\nnized under long-term indebtedness instead of short-term indebt-\\nedness. However, as at December 31, 2024, there had been no uti-\\nlization of the syndicated loan, so there was no effect as at the end \\nof the reporting period. As the amendments to IAS 1 are to be ap-\\nplied retrospectively with regard to a comparable presentation of \\nthe comparative periods, the disclosure of the utilization of the syn-\\ndicated loan was adjusted in the comparative period as at Decem-\\nber 31, 2023. In the comparative period as at December 31, 2023, \\ncompared with the published 2023 consolidated financial state-\\nments, the utilization of the syndicated loan in the amount of €316 \\nmillion was reclassified from short-term indebtedness to long-term \\nindebtedness. In the opening statement of financial position of the \\ncomparative period, compared with the published 2022 consoli-\\ndated financial statements, there was a reclassification of the utiliza-\\ntion of the syndicated loan in the amount of €300 million from \\nshort-term indebtedness to long-term indebtedness. \\nIn the year under review, the Continental Group utilized its com-\\nmercial paper programs, its sale-of-receivables programs and its \\nvarious bank lines to meet short-term credit requirements.  \\nPlease see Note 32 for the maturity structure of indebtedness.  \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n308\\nAdditional notes to the statement of cash flows \\nThe following table showing the (net) change in short-term and long-term indebtedness provides additional information on the consolidated \\nstatement of cash flows: \\n \\n  \\nCash \\nNon-cash \\n  \\n  \\n€ millions \\nDec. 31, 2024 \\n  \\nExchange- \\nrate changes \\nReclassi- \\nfications \\nChanges in \\nfair value \\nChanges in the \\nscope of  \\nconsolidation \\nOther1 Dec. 31, 2023 \\nChange in derivative instruments and interest-\\nbearing investments2 \\n231 \\n30 \\n2 \\n— \\n–10 \\n— \\n0 \\n209 \\nChange in short-term indebtedness3 \\n–2,797 \\n852 \\n–25 \\n–879 \\n–21 \\n1 \\n–83 \\n–2,642 \\nthereof redemption of bonds \\n— \\n725 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\nthereof repayment of lease liabilities \\n— \\n318 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\nChange in long-term indebtedness3 \\n–4,112 \\n–276 \\n–1 \\n879 \\n— \\n1 \\n–187 \\n–4,528 \\nthereof issuance of bonds \\n— \\n–600 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 Also includes, in addition to interest expense, the interest paid in the amount of €317 million reported under cash inflow arising from operating activities as well as effects from \\nthe recognition, derecognition and adjustment of lease liabilities. \\n2 The cash effects mainly result from money market funds and interest-bearing investments with banks, which are considered part of net indebtedness and are therefore classified \\nas financing activities. \\n3 Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, clarify the classification of current and non-current liabilities from the 2024 reporting year onward.

\\ncategory are classified as such because they are held over a long \\nterm for strategic purposes. \\nFor financial instruments accounted for at FVOCIwoR for which \\nthere are no quoted prices in active markets for identical instru-\\nments (Level 1) or for similar instruments, or for which there are no \\napplicable measurement methods in which all major input factors \\nare based on observable market data (Level 2), the fair value must \\nbe calculated using a measurement method for which the major  \\ninput factors are based on non-observable market data (Level 3).  \\nIf external valuation reports or information from other financing \\nrounds is available, these are used. If such information is not availa-\\nble, the measurement is performed according to the measurement \\nmethod that is deemed appropriate and realizable in each case: for \\nexample, according to the discounted cash flow method or by valu-\\nation according to multiples using ratios based on purchase prices \\nfor comparable transactions. Measurement at amortized cost is only \\nconsidered the best estimate of the fair value of financial assets if \\nthe most recent information available for fair value measurement is \\ninsufficient. Financial instruments accounted for at FVOCIwoR are \\ncentrally monitored with regard to any changes to the major non-\\nobservable input factors and continuously checked for changes in \\nvalue. \\nPlease see Note 18 for information on the changes in carrying \\namounts of other investments. For reasons of materiality, a sensitiv-\\nity analysis is not required.  \\nThe accounting and measurement methods applied are described \\nin Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \\nThe fair values of other indebtedness were derived from existing \\nquotations on an active market (Level 1) or alternatively were de-\\ntermined by discounting all future cash flows at the applicable in-\\nterest rates for the corresponding residual maturities, taking into \\naccount a company-specific credit spread (Level 2), provided their \\ncarrying amounts as at the reporting date are not approximately \\nequivalent to their fair values. The other financial instruments \\nmeasured at cost generally have short remaining terms. As a result, \\nthe carrying amounts as at the end of the reporting period are, as a \\nrule, approximately their fair values and are not shown in the fair \\nvalue hierarchy in the table. \\n \\nThe following table shows the changes to financial instruments at Level 3: \\n€ millions \\nOther  \\ninvestments \\nAs at January 1, 2023 \\n156 \\nValuation effects recognized in other comprehensive income \\n–62 \\nAdditions \\n2 \\nExchange-rate effects \\n–2 \\nAs at December 31, 2023 \\n93 \\nAs at January 1, 2024 \\n93 \\nValuation effects recognized in other comprehensive income \\n–4 \\nAdditions \\n7 \\nDebt-equity swap \\n1 \\nReclassification \\n–5 \\nChanges in the scope of consolidation \\n–6 \\nExchange-rate effects \\n2 \\nAs at December 31, 2024 \\n87 \\n \\n \\n \\nThe Continental Group recognizes possible reclassifications between \\nthe different levels of the fair value hierarchy as at the end of the \\nreporting period in which a change occurred.  \\nThe change in fair value recognized in other comprehensive in-\\ncome (OCI) of -€4 million (PY: -€62 million) relates to the overall \\nnegative revaluation of other financial assets as a result of changed \\nbusiness outlooks, of which equity investments still held by the \\nContinental Group account for -€8 million (PY: -€62 million) and \\ninvestments disposed of for €4 million (PY: €—).

There was an offsetting  \\neffect in exchange rate movements in the reporting year and the \\nprevious year.  \\nCollateral \\nAs at December 31, 2024, a total of €665 million (PY: €665 million) \\nof financial assets had been pledged as collateral. In the year under \\nreview, as in the previous year, collateral mainly consisted of trade \\naccounts receivable assigned as collateral for liabilities from sale-of-\\nreceivables programs. The remainder related to pledged cash or \\nother financial assets. \\nRisk management of financial instruments \\nDue to its international business activities and the resulting financ-\\ning requirements, the Continental Group is exposed to default risks, \\nrisks from changes in exchanges rates and variable interest rates, \\nand liquidity risk. The management of these risks is described in \\nthe following sections.  \\nIn addition, hedging instruments are used in the Continental Group. \\nTheir use is covered by corporate-wide policies, adherence to which \\nis regularly reviewed by internal auditors. Internal settlement risks \\nare minimized through the clear segregation of functional areas.  \\nFurther information about the risks presented below and about risk \\nmanagement can be found in the report on risks and opportunities \\nin the consolidated management report. \\n1. Default risks \\nDefault risks from trade accounts receivable, contract assets or \\nother financial assets include the risk that receivables will be col-\\nlected late or not at all if a customer or another contractual party \\ndoes not fulfill its contractual obligations. The total of the positive \\ncarrying amounts is equivalent to the maximum default risk of the \\nContinental Group from financial assets. Default risk is influenced \\nmainly by characteristics of the customers and the sector and is \\ntherefore analyzed and monitored by central and local credit man-\\nagers. The responsibilities of the credit management function also \\ninclude pooled receivables risk management. Contractual partners’ \\ncreditworthiness and payment history are analyzed on a regular \\nbasis. \\nDefault risk for non-derivative financial receivables is also limited by \\nensuring that agreements are entered into with partners with proven \\ncreditworthiness only or that collateral is provided or, in individual \\ncases, trade credit insurance is agreed. The Continental Group held \\nan immaterial amount of collateral as at December 31, 2024. There \\nare no trade accounts receivable or contract assets for which an \\nimpairment loss was not recognized due to collateral held. \\nHowever, default risk cannot be excluded with absolute certainty, \\nand any remaining risk is addressed by recognizing expected credit \\nlosses for identified individual risks and on the basis of experience, \\ntaking account of any relevant future components. Financial assets \\nthat are neither past due nor impaired accordingly have a prime \\ncredit rating. Default risks are calculated on the basis of corporate-\\nwide standards. The methods for calculating loss allowances are \\ndescribed in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial state-\\nments. As in the previous year, the annual review of the methods \\ndetermined that there was no need for adjustment in the reporting \\nyear. \\nTrade accounts receivable and contract assets \\nIf the creditworthiness of receivables is impaired, corresponding  \\nexpenses are recognized in an allowance account. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n313\\nLifetime expected credit losses are largely calculated using esti-\\nmates and assessments based on the creditworthiness of the re-\\nspective customer, current economic developments and the analy-\\nsis of historical losses on receivables. The creditworthiness of a cus-\\ntomer is assessed on the basis of its payment history and its ability \\nto make payments. It is regularly reviewed whether there is a need \\nto take account of any risks in connection with different customer \\ngroups, sectors or countries. No such allocation of default risk was \\nrequired in 2024. \\nContinental calculates the default rates for lifetime expected credit \\nlosses based on a three-year average, taking account of the histori-\\ncal defaults allocated to the different periods past due, and gener-\\nally also taking account of a forward-looking component. Trade ac-\\ncounts receivable and contract assets whose creditworthiness is al-\\nready impaired are not taken into account when calculating lifetime \\nexpected credit losses. There were no significant effects on expected \\ncredit losses from the modification of cash flows.  \\nThe table below shows the gross carrying amounts as at December 31, 2024, for trade accounts receivable and contract assets whose \\ncreditworthiness was not impaired1: \\n€ millions \\nDec. 31, 2024 \\nDec. 31, 2023 \\nnot overdue \\n6,610 \\n6,959 \\n0–29 days \\n270 \\n324 \\n30–59 days \\n93 \\n116 \\n60–89 days \\n36 \\n43 \\n90–119 days \\n24 \\n41 \\n120 days or more \\n152 \\n154 \\nAs at December 31 \\n7,185 \\n7,636 \\n \\n \\n \\n1 The difference of €179 million (December 31, 2023: €162 million) from the total gross carrying amounts of trade accounts receivable and contract assets results from the \\ngross carrying amounts of trade accounts receivable and contract assets whose creditworthiness was impaired. \\nIn the year under review, lifetime expected credit losses and loss allowances for trade accounts receivable and contract assets whose \\ncreditworthiness was impaired developed as follows: \\n€ millions \\n2024 \\n2023 \\nAs at January 1 \\n132 \\n138 \\nAdditions \\n72 \\n77 \\nUtilizations \\n–25 \\n–18 \\nReversals \\n–46 \\n–46 \\nAmounts disposed of through disposal of subsidiaries \\n–1 \\n–16 \\nExchange-rate changes \\n0 \\n–3 \\nAs at December 31 \\n133 \\n132 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAs at December 31, 2024, loss allowances for trade accounts re-\\nceivable whose creditworthiness was impaired amounted to €101 \\nmillion (PY: €101 million). \\nOf the impaired receivables written down in the reporting period, \\n€6 million (PY: €3 million) is still subject to enforcement measures. \\nOther financial assets \\nLoss allowances equivalent to the gross carrying amount totaling \\n€3 million (PY: €3 million) were recognized for other financial assets \\nwhose creditworthiness was impaired. Other 12-month and lifetime \\nexpected credit losses on other financial assets are not of significance.  \\nCash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments and interest-\\nbearing investments \\nIn order to minimize the default risk for cash and cash equivalents, \\nderivative instruments and interest-bearing investments, the Conti-\\nnental Group generally uses banks that it has classified as core \\nbanks on the basis of defined criteria. As a general rule, these banks \\nshould have at least one investment-grade credit rating from one of \\nthe global rating agencies. The default risk can therefore be consid-\\nered very low. The creditworthiness of the core banks – and of \\nother banks and other business partners with which investments \\nare made, loans are granted or derivative instruments are traded in \\nderogation from the core bank principle for operational or regula-\\ntory reasons – is continuously monitored by tracking not only their \\ncredit ratings but also particularly the premiums for insuring against \\ncredit risks (credit default swap, CDS), provided such information is \\navailable. In addition, the Continental Group sets investment limits \\nfor each bank and trading limits for derivative instruments. The \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n314\\namount of these limits is based on the creditworthiness of the re-\\nspective bank. Compliance with these limits is continuously moni-\\ntored. As in the previous year, expected credit losses from cash and \\ncash equivalents and other interest-bearing investments measured \\nat amortized cost as well as assets measured at amortized cost with \\nimpaired creditworthiness are not significant.  \\n2. Currency management \\nThe international nature of the Continental Group’s business activities \\nresults in deliveries and payments in various currencies. Currency-\\nexchange fluctuations involve the risk of losses because assets de-\\nnominated in currencies with a falling exchange rate lose value, \\nwhile liabilities denominated in currencies with a rising exchange \\nrate become more expensive. For hedging, it is allowed to use only \\nderivative instruments that have been defined in corporate-wide \\npolicies and can be reported and measured in the treasury man-\\nagement system. It is generally not permitted to use financial in-\\nstruments that do not meet these criteria. \\nOperational foreign-currency risk \\nIn operational currency management, actual and expected foreign-\\ncurrency cash flows are combined as operational foreign-exchange \\nexposures in the form of net cash flows for each transaction cur-\\nrency on a rolling 12-month basis. These cash flows arise mainly \\nfrom receipts and payments from external and intra-corporate \\ntransactions by the Continental Group’s subsidiaries worldwide. A \\nnatural hedge approach for reducing currency risks has been pur-\\nsued for several years, meaning that the difference between re-\\nceipts and payments in any currency is kept as low as possible. Ex-\\nchange-rate developments are also monitored, analyzed and fore-\\ncast. Based on the operational foreign-exchange exposure and con-\\nstantly updated exchange-rate forecasts, the interest-rate and cur-\\nrency committee, which convenes weekly, agrees on the hedging \\nmeasures to be implemented in individual cases by concluding de-\\nrivative instruments, particularly currency forwards, currency swaps \\nand currency options with a term of up to 12 months. Their amount \\nmust not exceed 30% of the 12-month exposure per currency \\nwithout Executive Board permission. In addition, further risk limits \\nfor open derivative positions are set, which considerably reduce the \\nrisks from hedging activities. Hedge accounting was not used in \\nthe reporting year or in the previous year for hedges concluded in \\nthis way. As at December 31, 2024, currency forwards to hedge \\noperational foreign currency risks were reported in the statement \\nof financial position under short-term derivative instruments and  \\ninterest-bearing investments in the amount of €1 million (PY: €0 \\nmillion) and under short-term indebtedness in the amount of €0 \\nmillion (PY: €0 million). Their nominal volume came to €102 million \\nas at December 31, 2024 (PY: €49 million).  \\nAs at December 31, 2024, the net exposure from financial instru-\\nments that are denominated in a currency other than the functional \\ncurrency of the respective subsidiary and are not allocated to net \\nindebtedness existed in the major currencies of the euro in the \\namount of -€347 million (PY: -€488 million) and the US dollar in the \\namount of -€362 million (PY: -€445 million). The main local curren-\\ncies accounting for the aforementioned euro-foreign currency \\ntransactions were the Chinese renminbi at -€208 million, the Ser-\\nbian dinar at -€83 million and the Mexican peso at -€59 million  \\n(PY: the Chinese renminbi at -€371 million, the Mexican peso \\nat -€82 million and the Serbian dinar at -€58 million). The main  \\nlocal currencies accounting for the US dollar-foreign currency \\ntransactions were the euro at €366 million, the South Korean won \\nat -€204 million and the Chinese renminbi at -€168 million (PY: the \\nChinese renminbi at -€165 million, the Romanian leu at -€121 mil-\\nlion and the South Korean won at -€114 million). Of these amounts, \\nthe positive values constitute net receivables and the negative val-\\nues net liabilities. \\nFinancial foreign-currency risks \\nIn addition to operational foreign-currency risk, currency risks also \\nresult from the Continental Group’s external and internal net indebt-\\nedness that is denominated in a currency other than the functional \\ncurrency of the respective subsidiary. The quantity of these instru-\\nments is regularly summarized in the form of a financial foreign-\\ncurrency exposure for each transaction currency. As at December \\n31, 2024, the net exposure in the major currencies amounted \\nto -€736 million (PY: -€876 million) for the euro and €592 million \\n(PY: €877 million) for the US dollar. The main local currencies ac-\\ncounting for the aforementioned euro-foreign currency transac-\\ntions were the Romanian leu at -€770 million, the Serbian dinar \\nat -€353 million and the Czech koruna at €245 million (PY: the Ro-\\nmanian leu at -€722 million, the Hungarian forint at -€271 million \\nand the Serbian dinar at -€186 million). The main local currencies \\naccounting for the US dollar-foreign currency transactions were the \\nMexican peso at €313 million, the Philippine peso at €227 million \\nand the Canadian dollar at -€82 million (PY: the euro at €356 mil-\\nlion, the Mexican peso at €350 million and the Philippine peso at \\n€169 million). These currency risks are generally hedged through \\nthe use of derivative instruments, particularly currency forwards, \\ncurrency swaps and cross-currency interest-rate swaps. Hedge  \\naccounting was not used in the reporting year or in the previous \\nyear for hedges concluded in this way. \\nHedging financial foreign-currency risks without using hedge \\naccounting \\nAs at December 31, 2024, there were derivative instruments to \\nhedge financial foreign-currency risks from intra-corporate receiva-\\nbles and liabilities. Hedge accounting is not used for these instru-\\nments, hence their assignment to the measurement category FVPL. \\nCorresponding currency forwards and currency swaps were re-\\nported as at December 31, 2024, in the statement of financial posi-\\ntion under short-term derivative instruments and interest-bearing \\ninvestments in the amount of €5 million (PY: €19 million), under \\nshort-term indebtedness in the amount of €29 million (PY: €7 mil-\\nlion) and in the previous year under long-term indebtedness in the \\namount of €1 million. Their nominal volume came to €1,008 mil-\\nlion as at December 31, 2024 (PY: €1,372 million). \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n315\\nHedging financial foreign-currency risks (net investment \\nhedges) \\nUntil August 2017, the Continental Group hedged its net invest-\\nments in foreign operations. Based on the decision that currency \\neffects from net investments in a foreign operation and from desig-\\nnated hedges that are accumulated in the currency translation re-\\nserve in equity are to be reclassified to the income statement only \\nif the foreign operation is sold or liquidated, €20 million (PY: €20 \\nmillion) from the hedged transactions remains in the currency \\ntranslation reserve in equity. \\nTranslation-related foreign-currency risks \\nA large number of the subsidiaries are located outside the euro cur-\\nrency zone. As Continental AG’s reporting currency in the consoli-\\ndated financial statements is the euro, the financial statements of \\nthese companies are translated into euros. With regard to manag-\\ning the risks of translation-related currency effects, it is assumed \\nthat investments in foreign companies are entered into for the long \\nterm and that earnings are reinvested. Translation-related effects \\nthat arise when the value of net asset items translated into euros \\nchanges as a result of exchange-rate fluctuations are recognized  \\ndirectly in equity in the consolidated financial statements and are \\ngenerally not hedged. \\nSensitivity analysis  \\nIFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, requires a presentation \\nof the effects of hypothetical changes in exchange rates on income \\nand equity using a sensitivity analysis. In the Continental Group,  \\nthe changes in the exchange rates are related to all financial instru-\\nments outstanding as at the end of the reporting period, including \\nthe effects of hedges. Forecast transactions and translation-related \\nforeign-currency risks are not included in the sensitivity analysis. \\nFor those financial instruments with transaction currencies that dif-\\nfer from the functional currencies, a 10% appreciation or deprecia-\\ntion of the respective functional currency of the subsidiaries in rela-\\ntion to the identified different transaction currencies is assumed to \\ndetermine the sensitivities. Hedging transactions are valued on the \\nbasis of a 10% percent change in the underlying forward or spot \\nrates from the perspective of the local currency of the hedging \\nContinental Group company.  \\n \\nThe following table shows, before income tax expense, the overall effect as measured using this approach, as well as the individual effects \\nresulting from the euro and the US dollar, as the major transaction currencies, on net income. As in the previous year, there is no effect on \\nequity according to this approach.\\n \\nLocal currency +10% \\nLocal currency –10% \\n€ millions \\n2024 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2023 \\nTotal \\n169 \\n194 \\n–169 \\n–194 \\nthereof EUR \\n106 \\n131 \\n–106 \\n–131 \\nthereof USD \\n–23 \\n–11 \\n23 \\n11 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3. Interest-rate management  \\nVariable interest agreements and, in principle, short-term financial \\ninstruments result in a risk of rising interest rates for interest-bear-\\ning financial liabilities and falling interest rates for interest-bearing \\nfinancial investments. These interest-rate risks are valuated and as-\\nsessed as part of our interest-rate management activities, partly on \\nthe basis of continuous monitoring of current and anticipated long-\\nterm and short-term interest-rate developments, and are managed \\nby means of derivative interest-rate hedging instruments as needed. \\nThe Continental Group’s interest-bearing net indebtedness is the \\nsubject of these activities based on the reporting date. Interest-rate \\nhedges serve exclusively to manage identified interest-rate risks. \\nOnce a year, a range is determined for the targeted share of fixed-\\ninterest indebtedness in relation to total gross indebtedness. As in \\nthe previous year, there were no derivative instruments to hedge \\ninterest-rate risks as at December 31, 2024. The Continental Group \\nis not exposed to a risk of fluctuation in the fair value of long-term \\nfinancial liabilities due to market changes in fixed interest rates, as \\nthe lenders do not have the right to demand early repayment in \\nthe event of changing rates and these liabilities are recognized at \\namortized cost. \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n316\\nInterest-rate risk \\nThe profile of interest-bearing financial instruments allocated to net indebtedness, taking into account the effect of the Continental \\nGroup’s derivative instruments, is as follows: \\n€ millions \\n2024 \\n2023 \\nFixed-interest instruments \\n  \\n  \\nFinancial assets \\n82 \\n57 \\nFinancial liabilities \\n5,168 \\n5,516 \\nFloating-rate instruments \\n  \\n  \\nFinancial assets \\n3,110 \\n3,056 \\nFinancial liabilities \\n1,712 \\n1,646 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFair value sensitivity analysis  \\nIn accordance with IFRS 7, effects of financial instruments on in-\\ncome and equity resulting from interest-rate changes must be pre-\\nsented using a sensitivity analysis.

The effects would essentially result from floating-rate finan-\\ncial instruments.

Liquidity risks  \\nCost-effective, adequate financing is necessary for the subsidiaries’ \\noperating business. The central cash management unit therefore \\nprepares a rolling liquidity forecast. This includes short-term detailed \\nplanning of incoming and outgoing payments in the immediate \\ndays to come as well as a long-term calculation of forecast data \\nbased on a time series analysis that is supplemented with updated \\ninformation on an ongoing basis. \\nVarious marketable financial instruments are used to meet the  \\nfinancial requirements. These comprise overnight money, term  \\nborrowing, the issue of commercial paper, sale-of-receivables pro-\\ngrams, the syndicated loan with a committed nominal amount of \\n€4,000 million (PY: €4,000 million) and other bilateral loans. Fur-\\nthermore, approximately 56% (PY: 55%) of gross indebtedness is \\nfinanced on the capital market in the form of long-term bonds. Cap-\\nital expenditure by subsidiaries is primarily financed through equity \\nand loans from banks or subsidiaries. There are also cash-pooling \\narrangements with subsidiaries to the extent they are possible and \\njustifiable in the relevant legal and tax situation. If events lead to  \\nunexpected financing requirements, the Continental Group can draw \\nupon existing liquidity and fixed credit lines from banks. For infor-\\nmation on existing liquidity, please refer to Note 24. For information \\non the existing utilized and unutilized loan commitments, please refer \\nto Note 31. In order to minimize risks with regard to the availability of \\nexisting liquidity, investment limits are in place, which are explained \\nunder “Default risks for cash and cash equivalents as well as deriva-\\ntive instruments and interest-bearing investments” in this note.  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n317\\nThe financial liabilities without lease liabilities of €13,496 million (PY: €14,522 million) result in the following undiscounted cash outflows \\nover the next five years and thereafter: \\nDec. 31, 2024/€ millions \\n2025 \\n2026 \\n2027 \\n2028 \\n2029 \\nthereafter \\nTotal \\nOther indebtedness incl. interest payments \\n2,533 \\n857 \\n1,211 \\n814 \\n633 \\n4 \\n6,052 \\nDerivative instruments with gross settlement – cash \\noutflows \\n858 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n858 \\nDerivative instruments with gross settlement – cash \\ninflows \\n–827 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n–827 \\nDerivative instruments with net settlement \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\nTrade accounts payable \\n6,471 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n6,471 \\nOther financial liabilities \\n1,250 \\n1 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n8 \\n1,260 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDec. 31, 2023/€ millions \\n2024 \\n2025 \\n2026 \\n2027 \\n2028 \\nthereafter \\nTotal \\nOther indebtedness incl. interest payments \\n2,823 \\n730 \\n858 \\n1,211 \\n793 \\n12 \\n6,428 \\nDerivative instruments with gross settlement – cash \\noutflows \\n379 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n379 \\nDerivative instruments with gross settlement – cash \\ninflows \\n–372 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n–372 \\nDerivative instruments with net settlement \\n1 \\n1 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n2 \\nTrade accounts payable \\n6,875 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n6,875 \\nOther financial liabilities \\n1,670 \\n4 \\n4 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\n1,678 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIn the analysis, foreign-currency amounts were translated into eu-\\nros using the current closing rate as at the end of the reporting pe-\\nriod. For floating-rate non-derivative financial instruments and float-\\ning-rate interest payments from derivative financial instruments, \\nthe future interest payment flows are generally forecast using the \\nmost recently contractually fixed interest rates. The analysis only in-\\ncludes cash outflows from financial liabilities. For derivative instru-\\nments that are liabilities at the end of the reporting period, the un-\\ndiscounted net payments are shown given a contractually specified \\nnet settlement; if gross settlement is contractually specified, the un-\\ndiscounted payment inflows and outflows are presented separately. \\nCash inflows from financial assets were not included.  \\nSupplier financing programs \\nThe Continental Group has several supplier financing programs. For \\nmore information, please refer to Note 34. These programs offer \\nsuppliers the opportunity to procure cash and cash equivalents at \\nfavorable terms from financial service providers prior to due dates \\nwithin the terms of payment. The terms of payment remain within \\na standard industry framework for corresponding trade accounts \\npayable so that no significant liquidity risks arise for Continental in \\nthe event of any potential termination of these programs. \\nGlobal netting agreements and similar agreements \\nContinental AG concludes business in the form of derivative instru-\\nments on the basis of the German Master Agreement on Financial \\nDerivatives Transactions (Deutscher Rahmenvertrag für Finanz-\\ntermingeschäfte). Fundamentally, there is the option to combine \\nthe amounts owed by each counterparty under such agreements \\non the same day in respect of all outstanding transactions in the \\nsame currency into a single net amount to be paid by one party to \\nanother.  \\nThe German Master Agreement on Financial Derivatives Transac-\\ntions does not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of  \\nfinancial position. This is due to the fact that Continental AG has no \\nlegal right to the netting of the amounts recognized at the current \\ntime. According to the regulations of the German Master Agreement, \\nthe right to netting can be enforced only when future events occur, \\nsuch as the insolvency of or default by a contractual party. In such \\ncases, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are ended, \\nthe fair value is calculated as at this time, and just a single net \\namount is paid to settle all transactions.  \\nAt a Brazilian subsidiary (PY: two Brazilian subsidiaries) there are \\nlocal framework agreements on the basis of which these compa-\\nnies have concluded derivative instruments. These agreements \\nalso do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of  \\nfinancial position. \\n \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n318\\nThe following table shows the carrying amounts of the reported stand-alone derivative instruments, their offsetting in the statement of \\nfinancial position, and any potential arising from the specified agreements subject to the occurrence of certain future events: \\n \\nDec. 31, 2024 \\nDec. 31, 2023 \\n€ millions \\nCarrying amounts1 \\nRespective \\nfinancial \\ninstruments \\nnot netted \\nNet amount \\nCarrying amounts1 \\nRespective \\nfinancial instruments \\nnot netted \\nNet amount \\nFinancial assets \\n5 \\n3 \\n2 \\n19 \\n4 \\n16 \\nFinancial liabilities \\n29 \\n3 \\n26 \\n8 \\n4 \\n5 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 There were no amounts to be offset in accordance with IAS 32.42 as at the reporting date and as at the same date in the previous year.  \\n33.

Please see Note 29 of \\nthe 2022 annual report for further details. \\n \\n34. Trade Accounts Payable \\nTrade accounts payable amounted to €6,471 million (PY: €6,875 \\nmillion) as at the end of the fiscal year. The liabilities are measured \\nat amortized cost. The full amount is due within one year.  \\nFor information on liquidity risk, currency risk and the sensitivity \\nanalysis for trade accounts payable, please see Note 32.  \\nThe Continental Group has several supplier financing programs. \\nHowever, trade accounts payable that fall under these programs  \\nremain under the item trade accounts payable even if they are pre-\\nfinanced by a financial institution to suppliers, as the character and \\nthe function of such trade accounts payable is not materially altered \\nby the programs (no material modification). For this reason, and \\ndue to the continued standard industry terms of payment for liabili-\\nties under these programs, there is also no impact on the consoli-\\ndated statement of cash flows. \\nAs at December 31, 2024, trade accounts payable totaling €65 \\nmillion were recognized within the Continental Group, which are at-\\ntributable to the aforementioned programs. Continental has no in-\\nformation on the actual amount of prefinancing. It is assumed that \\nthe entire volume of trade accounts payable to suppliers has been \\nprefinanced. The terms of payment of the trade accounts payable \\nunder the aforementioned programs are essentially comparable to \\nother trade accounts payable of relevant companies of the Conti-\\nnental Group. \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n319\\n35.

Litigation and Compensation Claims \\nContinental AG and its subsidiaries are involved in lawsuits, regula-\\ntory investigations and proceedings worldwide. Such lawsuits, in-\\nvestigations and proceedings could also be initiated or claims as-\\nserted in other ways in the future. \\nProduct liability \\nIn particular, Continental is subject to product liability and other \\nclaims in which the company is accused of the alleged infringe-\\nment of its duty of care, violations against warranty obligations or \\ndefects of material or workmanship. Claims from alleged breaches \\nof contract resulting from product recalls or government proceed-\\nings are also asserted. Among other cases, claimants in the USA file \\nlawsuits for property damage, personal injury and death caused by \\nalleged defects in our products. Claims for material and non-mate-\\nrial damages, and in some cases punitive damages, are asserted. \\nThe outcome of individual proceedings, which are generally decided \\nby a jury in a court of first instance, cannot be predicted with cer-\\ntainty. No assurance can be given that Continental will not incur sub-\\nstantial expenses as a result of the final judgments or settlements in \\nsome of these cases, or that these amounts will not exceed any pro-\\nvisions set up for these claims. Some subsidiaries in the USA are ex-\\nposed to relatively limited claims for damages from purported health \\ninjuries allegedly caused by products containing asbestos. The total \\ncosts for dealing with all such claims and proceedings have \\namounted to less than €50 million per year since 2006.  \\nDisputes over industrial property rights \\nContinental could be liable to pay compensation for infringements \\nor could be forced to purchase licenses to continue using technol-\\nogy from third parties. Continental, for example, supplies telecom-\\nmunication modules that transmit vehicle data, enable voice and in-\\nternet functionality, and are compatible with cellular communica-\\ntion standards. In this respect, there is a risk that Continental may \\nnow be dependent on licenses and the conditions under which \\nthey are granted to customers in order to use patents relating to \\nthese standards (standard essential patents), especially in the field \\nof telecommunications standards such as 3G, 4G or 5G, as Conti-\\nnental was in some cases denied the acquisition of its own licenses \\nin the year under review. Continental has formed provisions to \\ncover the risks of any compensation payments in this regard. In ac-\\ncordance with IAS 37.92 and GAS 20.154, no further disclosures \\nwill be made so as not to adversely affect the company’s interests. \\nRegulatory proceedings \\nIn May 2005, the Brazilian competition authorities (Conselho Ad-\\nministrativo de Defesa Econômica, CADE) opened investigations \\nagainst Continental’s Brazilian subsidiary Continental Brasil Indus-\\ntria Automotiva Ltda., Guarulhos, Brazil (CBIA), following a com-\\nplaint of anticompetitive behavior in the area of commercialization \\nof tachographs. On August 18, 2010, the Brazilian antitrust authori-\\nties determined an “invitation to cartel” and imposed a fine of BRL \\n12 million (around €2 million) on CBIA, which was then reduced to \\nBRL 11 million (around €2 million). CBIA denies the accusation that \\nit has infringed Brazilian antitrust law. Although the court of first in-\\nstance appealed to by CBIA upheld the decision, on CBIA’s further \\nappeal the next higher court annulled this decision and remanded \\nthe matter. In February 2023, the court of first instance rendered a \\nverdict against CBIA and lifted the ban on the enforcement of the \\nfinancial penalty against CBIA (at that time an amount of around \\nBRL 34 million [around €5 million]). CBIA filed a motion for clarifica-\\ntion requesting that the preliminary injunction against enforcement \\nremain in full force up until a final and unappealable ruling is made. \\nThis motion was denied, and CBIA filed an appeal against this deci-\\nsion. In December 2024, CBIA participated in an initiative by CADE \\nto settle the long-standing proceedings without admission of guilt \\nby the company in exchange for a considerable reduction in the \\nfine. Accordingly, CBIA concluded a settlement agreement with \\nCADE under which CBIA must pay BRL 14 million (around €2 mil-\\nlion) to CADE in 2025. CBIA has withdrawn its final appeal (on the \\ncondition that CADE’s settlement measures are finalized). Once the \\npayment has been made and the appeal withdrawn, the case will \\nbe closed. Third parties may, in addition, claim damages from CBIA. \\nOn October 2, 2006, South African antitrust authorities received  \\na complaint from a third party accusing several South African tire \\nmanufacturers of alleged antitrust behavior, including Continental \\nTyre South Africa (Pty.) Ltd., Port Elizabeth, South Africa (CTSA), a \\nsubsidiary of Continental. On August 31, 2010, the South African \\nantitrust authorities came to the conclusion that CTSA had violated \\nSouth African antitrust law and referred the matter to the responsi-\\nble antitrust court for decision. CTSA denies the allegation of in-\\nfringements of South African antitrust law. However, the tribunal \\ncould impose a fine of up to 10% of CTSA’s sales. In addition, third \\nparties may also claim damages from CTSA in case of an infringe-\\nment of South African competition law. \\nAs a result of investigations by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nand the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) in connection with \\nsuspected involvement in violations of US and South Korean anti-\\ntrust law in the instrument cluster business, which came to light in \\n2012, the KFTC imposed a fine on Continental Automotive Elec-\\ntronics LLC, Bugang-myeon, South Korea (CAE), at the end of 2013, \\nthe final amount of which was set in 2018 at KRW 32,101 million \\n(around €21 million). In the USA, CAE and Continental Automotive \\nKorea Ltd., Seongnam-si, South Korea, agreed in 2015 to pay a fine \\nof US $4 million (approximately €4 million). In the proceedings re-\\nlating to class action lawsuits filed in the USA and Canada for al-\\nleged damages resulting from the antitrust violations, settlements \\ntotaling US $5 million (around €5 million) were concluded in the \\nUSA in 2018 and settlements totaling around CAN $0.6 million \\n(around €0.4 million) concluded in Canada in 2020. The risk of  \\ninvestigations by other antitrust authorities into this matter and \\nclaims for damages by further alleged victims remain unaffected  \\nby the fines imposed.  \\nAs a result of investigations that came to light in 2014, the Euro-\\npean Commission imposed a fine of €44 million on Continental AG; \\nContinental Teves AG & Co. oHG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; and \\nContinental Automotive GmbH, Hanover, Germany; on February 21, \\n2018, for the unlawful exchange of information. This involved spe-\\ncific brake components. Continental has paid this fine. Customers \\nhave since approached Continental to claim for damages, in some \\nOther Disclosures \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n321\\ncases for specific amounts. Mercedes-Benz Group AG filed for de-\\nclaratory judgment action with the Hanover District Court against \\nContinental AG and two other companies of the Continental Group \\nin December 2022, which initially related only to claims from remu-\\nneration in 2008/09. This declaratory judgment action was con-\\nverted to an action for performance in April 2024. In April 2023, \\nseveral companies of the Stellantis Group as well as several compa-\\nnies of the Renault Group filed a civil lawsuit in each case against \\nContinental AG and two other companies of the Continental Group \\nas well as several ZF and Bosch companies before the High Court \\nin London, United Kingdom. Both the Renault Group and the Stel-\\nlantis Group have since withdrawn their lawsuits. In addition, two \\nclass action lawsuits have been filed in Canada against Continental \\nAG and several of its subsidiaries. These proceedings were settled \\nin November 2024. Final closure of these class action lawsuits is \\nexpected in the first half of 2025, subject to court approval. Conti-\\nnental believes that these claims and the lawsuit by Mercedes-Benz \\nare without merit. However, should the lawsuits lead to a judgment \\nagainst Continental, the resulting expenses could be substantial \\nand exceed the provision set aside for this purpose. In accordance \\nwith IAS 37.92 and GAS 20.154, no further disclosures will be made \\nwith regard to the proceedings and the related measures so as not \\nto adversely affect the company’s interests. \\nOn March 3, 2021, the Brazilian antitrust authorities (CADE), acting \\non the basis of the issues addressed by the European Commission \\nand described above, formally initiated proceedings against Conti-\\nnental Teves AG & Co. oHG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and cer-\\ntain former employees for alleged unlawful exchange of competi-\\ntion-sensitive information concerning hydraulic brake systems. Con-\\ntinental considers it possible that these proceedings will end with  \\na fine. Continental is therefore unable to predict in any reliable way \\nwhat the outcome of these proceedings will be. If Continental is \\nfound responsible for any violation, CADE could impose a fine on \\nthe company of 0.1% to 20% of the revenue generated by the \\ncompany or by the Continental Group in Brazil in the year prior to \\nwhen the administrative proceedings were launched (2020). Non-\\npecuniary penalties may also be possible. Furthermore, customers \\npurportedly affected by the alleged exchange of information could \\nclaim for damages if indeed a violation of Brazilian antitrust law is \\nestablished.  \\nSince 2020, the public prosecutor’s office in Hanover has been \\nconducting investigative proceedings against former employees  \\nas well as former board members of Continental AG suspected of \\ncommitting criminal acts and breaches of supervisory duties in \\nconnection with the development and use of illegal defeat devices \\nin diesel and gasoline engines of multiple automotive manufactur-\\ners. The fine proceedings conducted by the public prosecutor’s of-\\nfice in Hanover against Continental AG and other group companies \\nin this regard were legally concluded in the second quarter of 2024 \\nby payment of a fine totaling €100 million. The company had already \\nmade appropriate provisions. \\nVitesco Technologies and Continental AG, acting on the basis of \\nand in accordance with contractual provisions, particularly those \\nset forth in the corporate separation agreement concluded as part \\nof the spin-off of Vitesco Technologies, reached an agreement re-\\ngarding the appropriate allocation of costs and liabilities from the \\ninvestigations conducted by the public prosecutor’s offices in \\nFrankfurt am Main (until the end of 2022) and Hanover. Accord-\\ningly, Vitesco Technologies paid Continental €125 million in the \\nthird quarter. \\nAs part of industry-wide searches, the European Commission began \\nconducting a search of the premises of Continental AG on January \\n30, 2024, due to alleged antitrust violations. On the same day, Ger-\\nmany’s Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) searched the prem-\\nises of TON Tyres Over Night Trading GmbH, Schondra-Schildeck, \\nGermany, a subsidiary of Continental, also due to alleged industry-\\nwide antitrust violations. Both proceedings are at an early stage. In \\nthe event that Continental is responsible for any such violation, the \\nEuropean Commission and the Bundeskartellamt could each im-\\npose substantial fines. Furthermore, customers purportedly affected \\nby the alleged exchange of information could claim for damages.  \\nIn this context, class action lawsuits have already been filed in the \\nUSA and Canada against Continental and other tire manufacturers. \\nThe lawsuits in the USA have been consolidated before the United \\nStates District Court, Northern District of Ohio.

In conjunction \\nwith this, in October 2024 the Italian authorities began a company \\naudit of Continental AG as the parent company for the fiscal years \\n2016 to 2023. Continental is fully cooperating with the investigat-\\ning authorities and is clarifying this matter internally. Continental \\nhas formed provisions to cover any risks in this regard. In accord-\\nance with IAS 37.92 and GAS 20.154, no further disclosures will  \\nbe made so as not to adversely affect the company’s interests. \\nOn September 24, 2024, the Turkish Competition Authority (TCA) \\nconducted a search of the business premises of Otomotiv Lastikleri \\nTevzi AS (OLTAS), Istanbul, Türkiye, due to alleged antitrust violations. \\nOn December 3, 2024, the TCA published its notice of investiga-\\ntion and initiated an in-depth investigation into the matter. The pro-\\nceedings are at an early stage. Continental is unable to predict in \\nany reliable way what the outcome of these proceedings will be. In \\nthe event that OLTAS is responsible for any violation, the TCA could \\nimpose substantial fines.

Transactions with Related Parties  \\nRemuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board  \\nThe remuneration of the Continental Group’s key management personnel that must be disclosed in accordance with IAS 24, Related Party \\nDisclosures, comprises the remuneration of the active members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. \\nThe remuneration of the active members of the Executive Board in the respective years was as follows: \\n€ thousands \\n2024 \\n2023 \\nShort-term benefits \\n9,235 \\n10,188 \\nService cost relating to post-employment benefits \\n4,310 \\n3,657 \\nTermination benefits \\n36 \\n— \\nShare-based payment \\n5,031 \\n9,473 \\nTotal \\n18,612 \\n23,318 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe total remuneration of the members of the Executive Board \\ncomprises a number of remuneration components. These include a \\nremuneration component that is unrelated to performance, includ-\\ning specific additional benefits and entitlement to a company pen-\\nsion, and a variable component that is based on performance, con-\\nsisting of a short-term remuneration component and long-term re-\\nmuneration components. \\nAdditional benefits include (i) provision of a company car, which \\ncan also be for personal use, (ii) reimbursement of travel expenses, \\nas well as relocation costs and expenses for running a second \\nhousehold, where this is required for work reasons, (iii) a regular \\nhealth check, (iv) directors’ and officers’ (D&O) liability insurance \\nwith deductible in accordance with Section 93 (2) Sentence 3 AktG, \\n(v) accident insurance, (vi) the employers’ liability insurance associ-\\nation contribution including, where necessary, income tax incurred \\nas a result, as well as (vii) health insurance and long-term care in-\\nsurance contributions based on Section 257 of Book V of the Ger-\\nman Social Code (SGB V) and Section 61 of Book XI of the German \\nSocial Code (SGB XI). \\nIn accordance with the regulations in force until December 31, \\n2023, each Executive Board member appointed until this date was \\ngranted (as part of their future benefit rights) post-employment \\nbenefits paid starting at the age of 63, but not before leaving the \\nservice of Continental AG (hereinafter “insured event”). From Janu-\\nary 1, 2014, the company pension for the members of the Execu-\\ntive Board was changed to a defined contribution commitment. A \\ncapital component is credited to the Executive Board member’s \\npension account each year. To determine this, a fixed contribution, \\nagreed by the Supervisory Board in the Executive Board member’s \\nservice agreement, is multiplied by an age factor that represents an \\nappropriate return. For members of the Executive Board who were \\nalready in office prior to January 1, 2014, the future benefit rights \\naccrued until December 31, 2013, have been converted into a \\nstarting component in the capital account. When the insured event \\noccurs, the benefits are paid out as a lump sum, in installments or – \\nas is normally the case due to the expected amount of the benefits \\n– as a pension. Post-employment benefits must be adjusted after \\ncommencement of such benefit payments by 1% p.a. in \\naccordance with Section 16 (3) No. 1 of the German Company \\nPensions Law (Betriebsrentengesetz – BetrAVG). \\nThe variable components that are based on performance comprise \\na short-term remuneration component (performance bonus with-\\nout equity deferral) as well as long-term remuneration components \\n(long-term incentive and equity deferral of the performance bonus). \\nFor the variable remuneration components, before the start of each \\nfiscal year, target criteria are determined by the Supervisory Board \\nwith a view to its strategic goals, the provisions of Sections 87 and \\n87a AktG and the German Corporate Governance Code in its re-\\nspective valid version, whereby the degree to which these criteria \\nare met will determine the actual amount paid out. \\nThe Supervisory Board may take the function and area of responsi-\\nbility of the individual members of the Executive Board into account \\nwith regard to the amount of the total target-based remuneration. \\nAs part of this, shares of the individual remuneration component \\nfor the total target-based remuneration are indicated below in per-\\ncentage ranges. The precise shares therefore vary depending on \\nthe functional differentiation as well as any adjustments made as \\npart of the annual remuneration review.  \\nThe fixed annual salary comprises 20% to 30% of the target total \\nremuneration, the performance bonus (excluding equity deferral) \\nbetween 17% and 22%, and the equity deferral and long-term in-\\ncentive between 33% and 38%. The pension allowance makes up \\naround 7% to 9% of the target total remuneration. For Executive \\nBoard members appointed prior to January 1, 2024, the future \\nbenefit rights account for around 13% to 28% of the target total  \\nremuneration, while the additional benefits make up around 1%  \\nof the target total remuneration.  \\nFor a more detailed description of the remuneration system’s varia-\\nble components based on performance as well as the obligations \\ndue, please see Note 28. \\nProvisions for defined benefit obligations of current members of \\nthe Executive Board amount to €26 million (PY: €23 million).  \\n', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\n325\\nProvisions for severance payments and other salaries for active  \\nExecutive Board members and those who departed in the previous \\nyear and earlier years amounted to €0 million in the reporting year \\n(PY: €9 million).  \\nThe total remuneration granted to the Executive Board of Continen-\\ntal AG in 2024 in accordance with Section 314 (1) No. 6 of the Ger-\\nman Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB) amounted to \\n€17 million (PY: €19 million). That total remuneration also included, \\nin addition to short-term benefits of €9 million (PY: €10 million), a \\nnewly granted long-term incentive plan totaling €6 million (PY: €6 \\nmillion) and the equity deferral of the performance bonus of €2 \\nmillion (PY: €3 million).  \\nThe fair value of the 2024 LTI plan as at the grant date, assuming \\nfull vesting, was €5 million (PY: €4 million for the 2023 LTI plan). \\nMoreover, former members of the Executive Board and their surviv-\\ning dependents received payments totaling €9 million (PY: €10 mil-\\nlion). Provisions for pension obligations for former members of the \\nExecutive Board and their surviving dependents amounted to \\n€147 million (PY: €151 million).  \\nRemuneration paid to the members of Continental AG’s Supervisory \\nBoard, including meeting fees, totaled €5 million in the past fiscal \\nyear (PY: €5 million). \\nAs in 2023, no advances or loans were granted to members of \\nContinental AG’s Executive Board or Supervisory Board in 2024. \\n \\n \\nThe table below shows the transactions with related parties other than subsidiaries.  \\n \\nIncome \\nExpenses \\nAccounts receivable \\nAccounts payable \\n€ millions \\n2024 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2023 \\n2024 \\n2023 \\nNon-consolidated companies \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nOrdinary business activities \\n20 \\n17 \\n6 \\n2 \\n8 \\n6 \\n6 \\n4 \\nOther \\n1 \\n1 \\n0 \\n0 \\n— \\n4 \\n— \\n2 \\nAssociates \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nOrdinary business activities \\n34 \\n37 \\n150 \\n139 \\n9 \\n14 \\n33 \\n28 \\nFinancing \\n0 \\n0 \\n9 \\n6 \\n0 \\n14 \\n— \\n233 \\nOther \\n— \\n0 \\n— \\n— \\n0 \\n— \\n— \\n— \\nJoint ventures \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nOrdinary business activities \\n30 \\n55 \\n3 \\n21 \\n18 \\n21 \\n84 \\n88 \\nFinancing \\n1 \\n2 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n25 \\n— \\n1 \\nSchaeffler Group1 \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nOrdinary business activities \\n359 \\n700 \\n429 \\n626 \\n60 \\n512 \\n48 \\n65 \\nOther \\n126 \\n4 \\n0 \\n0 \\n7 \\n8 \\n0 \\n— \\nTotal \\n570 \\n816 \\n597 \\n795 \\n103 \\n605 \\n171 \\n419 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 All disclosures constitute transactions with the Schaeffler Group/Vitesco Technologies (until the merger on October 1, 2024).

The company also mentions that it has a Code of Conduct that forms the basis for collaboration among all employees, which includes respect for human rights and labor standards (Source: 177). Additionally, the report highlights that Continental AG has a management approach to respect for human rights and labor standards that is in line with international frameworks (Source: 177).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, upon closer examination, it appears that the company's human rights policy commitments are not explicitly stated in a single paragraph or section, but rather scattered throughout the report. Furthermore, the report does not provide concrete data or quantifiable metrics to support its claims, which raises concerns about the effectiveness of its human rights policy commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company's statement that it \"firmly rejects any form of child labor\" (Source: 176) can be seen as a cheap talk, as it is a statement that is costless to make but may not necessarily reflect the true intentions or future actions of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while the company describes its human rights policy commitments relevant to its own workforce, the report lacks concrete data and quantifiable metrics to support its claims, which raises concerns about the effectiveness of its human rights policy commitments.\n",

The report also mentions that \"Low representation in some EEA countries is linked to countries with small headcounts,\" but this does not necessarily imply that there are gaps in social protection coverage.

The report highlights various measures aimed at promoting the well-being of its workforce, including initiatives for women, addressing structural conditions, and promoting training and skill development. For instance, the company mentions that the specific initiatives for women focus on the entire female workforce, also beyond management positions (Source 185). Additionally, the report notes that the actions relating to the structural conditions are much broader and ultimately address the entire workforce (Source 185). Furthermore, the company highlights positive impacts on secure employment, social dialogue, training and skill development, and employees' working time (Sources 46, 47, 48, and 42). However, it is essential to note that these initiatives might be subject to greenwashing, and the report's authenticity should be scrutinized.\n",
