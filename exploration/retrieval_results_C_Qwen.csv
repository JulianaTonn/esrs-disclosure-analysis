The IRO assessment led to a deeper understanding of which parts \nof the workforce are at greater risk of harm based on particular ac-\ntivities, contexts or characteristics. This understanding results in \nparticular from the consideration of industry specifics, regional \ncharacteristics and potential discriminatory features as part of the \nIRO assessment, as described in the respective IROs.

These are subdivided into \nthe following areas: labor standards, adequate wages, work-life bal-\nance, training and skill development, secure employment and social \ndialogue, employee privacy, and occupational safety and health. Labor standards \nContinental has defined an approach for the management of labor \nstandards for its own workforce that is intended to prevent and re-\nduce actual and potential negative impacts and risks as well as \nstrengthen positive impacts with regard to working time, discrimi-\nnation, forced labor and child labor as well as other human rights \nand working conditions. This is part of the “Responsible Value \nChain Due Diligence System” (RVCDDS). Continental is thus pursuing the ambition of creating good work-\ning conditions and a 100 % responsible value chain by 2050 at \nthe latest. As part of the RVCDDS, Continental has adopted so-\ncalled Responsible Value Chain Commitments (RVC commit-\nments), which include the following for the area of labor stand-\nards: no child labor, fair payment, equal treatment, no forced la-\nbor or modern slavery, freedom of association and working con-\nditions, including working time. With the specific RVC commitment for equal treatment, Continental \nstrives for a working environment that is free from discrimination, \nincluding harassment, in any form. This is an integral part of the \nmanagement system and is supported by dedicated diversity man-\nagement aimed at promoting equal opportunities and advancing \ndiversity and inclusion.'), Document(id='7bd6d978-2f08-4dbe-94d8-bab4db456152', metadata={'source': '472', 'page': '185'}, page_content='The actions relating to \nthe structural conditions are much broader and ultimately address \nthe entire workforce.

As indicated by the respective descriptions, all identified risks result \ndirectly from identified actual and potential impacts.

Therefore, the risks are inherently linked to Continental’s strategy \nand business model. The assessment of material impacts takes into account all workers \nin the value chain but is explicitly focused on workers in Conti-\nnental’s supply chain. Connections to the company’s own opera-\ntions, product portfolio and business relationships are taken into ac-\ncount where relevant. As Continental sources goods, materials and services from numer-\nous industries along the value chain, this essentially has an actual \nor potential impact on all types of workers. Workers who work on \nContinental’s premises but are not counted as part of the com-\npany’s own workforce, as well as workers who work for direct sup-\npliers or indirect suppliers in the deeper value chain, are considered \nto be particularly affected. In both cases, this includes vulnerable \ngroups such as migrant workers. The impacts on workers in the \ndownstream value chain are rather considered as indirect. Workers \nin Continental’s joint ventures are especially impacted if the joint \nventure is also a supplier. Continental’s assessment of the impacts, risks and opportunities \ndid not focus on workers in the value chain with specific character-\nistics or in specific activities and contexts, and accordingly did not \nprovide an understanding of a greater exposure to harm. These specifics include the fact that Continental’s global value \nchain includes many industries, countries and markets and thus \nalso regions in which there is a significant potential for negative im-\npacts with regard to child labor, forced labor or compulsory labor, \nin particular in Pakistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nor industries such as the quarrying of stone, sand and clay or grow-\ning of perennial crops. The assessment of the material negative impacts regarding work-\ners in the value chain was integrated in the general impact, risk and \nopportunity assessment following the defined methodology. The \nmethodology takes into consideration two perspectives: All nega-\ntive impacts are to be considered widespread or systemic as they \nrelate to countries, certain markets, industries and business activi-\nties or other business relationships in Continental’s value chain. In \naddition, the methodology takes into account actual event-based \nnegative impacts wherever the impact description contains a refer-\nence to concrete actual incidents. Material risks arising from the impacts on workers in the value \nchain are not attributable to specific groups of people but are de-\npendent on industries and geographical aspects.

These are described at the \nbeginning of the section. These negative impacts are linked to \nContinental’s strategy and business model and relate in particular \nto countries, certain markets and industries of the supplier base \nand Continental’s own operations, which are exposed to such im-\npacts to a critical or significant extent. The development of measures and strategic decisions based on \nthe impacts identified is described in this sustainability report as \npart of the management approaches Environmental protection in \nown operations, Environmental protection in the supply chain, and \nSubstances of concern and very high concern in the Pollution \n(ESRS E2) section as well as Labor standards in the Own workforce \n(ESRS S1) section and in the Workers in the value chain (ESRS S2) \nsection. The identified risk is not related to a dependency on affected com-\nmunities, but rather to geographical and industry-related aspects. As indicated by the description, it results directly from the identified \npotential impacts and is also based on the breadth and diversity of \ncountries, markets and industries in Continental’s own operations \nand supplier base. The risk is therefore inherently linked to Continental’s strategy and \nbusiness model. As Continental sources goods, materials and services from numer-\nous industries along the value chain, this essentially has potential \nimpacts on all types of affected communities. Communities living \nor working near Continental sites or near to companies in Conti-\nnental’s supply chain are considered to be particularly affected. In \nboth cases, this also includes indigenous people. The impacts on \ncommunities in the downstream value chain are rather considered \nas indirect. Continental’s assessment of the impacts, risks and opportunities \ndid not focus on affected communities with specific characteristics \nor in specific activities and contexts, and accordingly did not pro-\nvide an understanding of specific exposure to harm. The assessment of the material negative impacts regarding own \nworkforce was integrated in the general impact, risk and oppor-\ntunity assessment following the defined methodology. All negative impacts are considered widespread or systemic as \nthey relate to countries, certain markets and industries in Conti-\nnental’s own operations or supplier base.

The integration of these interests into the system is \ncarried out as part of the annual review process. Continental communicates its management approach through the \nexternally published RVC commitments and the Public Policy \nStatement. Training initiatives for suppliers are also carried out to \nfurther promote shared responsibility along the entire value chain. In addition, direct suppliers are requested to sign the Business \nPartner Code of Conduct. The communication is thus aimed at af-\nfected stakeholders as well as stakeholders involved in the imple-\nmentation. Processes for engaging with value chain workers about \nimpacts \nThe engagement with workers in the value chain is part of the con-\ntinuous development of the management approach described. A key element of this is the participation in dialogue formats of  \nassociations and initiatives with external stakeholders, such as the \nsector dialogue for the automotive industry and the dialogue with \nlabor unions. Participation in and maintenance of these dialogue \nformats take place on a continuous basis. If required, topic- or \nevent-specific discussions take place. The knowledge thus gained \nabout the interests of workers in the value chain supports the  \ndevelopment of a shared understanding of industry-related risks \nand impacts on stakeholders and the resulting due diligence  \nobligations. The processes and activities regarding the detection and mitigation \nof negative impacts are managed through the RVCDDS and also \ninclude cases that are reported by workers in the value chain via \nContinental’s integrity system. The integrity system is described in \nmore detail in the subsection Processes to remediate negative  \nimpacts and channels for workers in the value chain to raise con-\ncerns in this section. This is a form of direct engagement with af-\nfected stakeholders, in addition to the participation in initiatives \nand associations. Governance and responsibility for the processes are regulated \nwithin the RVCDDS as described in the management approach. The \nannual review process anchored in the RVCDDS includes a consoli-\ndation and analysis of relevant information. As an integral part of \nthis, the actual negative impacts identified via the bottom-up im-\npact and risk analysis, as well as case management, are reviewed, \nand the effectiveness of the established processes is monitored. The engagement with particularly vulnerable workers in the value \nchain is addressed mostly indirectly, e.g. by the RVC commitment \non equal treatment. Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for \nworkers in the value chain to raise concerns \n \nGrievance channels for value chain workers \nContinental has established dedicated mechanisms to enable workers \nin the value chain to raise concerns. These are part of a comprehensive integrity system that comprises \nthree channels: an integrity portal, an integrity hotline and an integrity \ne-mail address, as described in more detail in the Business conduct \nand corporate governance (ESRS G1) section. Employees as well as \nthird parties outside the Continental Group can report violations of le-\ngal regulations, fundamental values and ethical standards via these \nchannels. The platform and hotline are managed by an external ser-\nvice provider, while the integrity e-mail is managed directly by a Conti-\nnental case management team. The integrity channels can be accessed through our website or via an \ninternational phone hotline and are explicitly also open for workers in \nthe value chain. They are available worldwide in many different lan-\nguages and accessible 24/7, creating broad availability by overcom-\ning barriers such as time zones or languages. The integrity system is governed by a dedicated rule that defines roles \nand responsibilities along the process steps of reporting, report ad-\nministration and substantiation, investigation, and sanctioning – in an \nend-to-end process. The case management is also subject to internal \naudits. In addition, Continental’s publicly available rules of procedure \nprovide transparency on the handling of cases.

Formalized processes especially include the rep-\nresentation of employees by works councils or similar structures as \nwell as the regular employee survey OUR BASICS Live. In addition, \nContinental has established a variety of formats for social dialogue \nand employee engagement, including townhall meetings, networks, \nopen calls and online platforms. This foundation for social dialogue \nis also the basis for managing employment matters in the transition \nof our industries. With regard to secure employment, Continental has established a \nset of processes, projects and measures. They mitigate the nega-\ntive impacts of the transformation on employees and simultane-\nously create positive effects in terms of the creation of jobs and up-\nskilling. › In contract design, the focus is on providing employees with long-\nterm offers. Flexible working time, mobile work options, and other \nbenefits regarding employee working conditions, as described in \nthe management approaches to work-life balance and adequate \nwages, are intended to proactively reduce employee turnover. › With regard to the impacts of the transformation, Continental has \ncreated a range of opportunities to prepare employees for the job \nmarket of the future. These are set out in the management ap-\nproach to training and skill development. › Job changes are also supported through a global internal job \nmarket. › Especially in Germany, which is significantly affected by transfor-\nmation processes - for example, due to increasing digitalization \nand technological change – Continental has established pro-\ncesses to support employees in external job transitions to other \nemployers that offer better employment opportunities at the re-\nspective location (“von Arbeit in Arbeit”). These processes also in-\nclude discussions with potential external employers. The effectiveness of the management approach is monitored via \ndedicated feedback channels, HR processes and the reported metrics \n“Percentage of employees covered by employee representation”, \n“Employee turnover” and the OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engage-\nment index. The processes are regulated through Continental’s internal HR rules \nand by-laws as well as agreements with works councils. Key aspects regarding secure employment and social dialogue are \nregulated in particular by local laws, regulations and regulatory pro-\nvisions. By definition, social dialogue is an interest-based exchange with \nemployees and their representatives. In order to gain further in-\nsights and consider the interests of its own workforce in the man-\nagement approach, Continental uses its internal communication \nchannels and has integrated feedback processes into various en-\ngagement formats and training courses. An additional formalized \nprocess is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey, which gathers \nthe employee’s opinions and views on various topics related to \nContinental’s values. These are recorded, consolidated and ana-\nlyzed in an established process. Furthermore, co-determination \npractices such as employee representation on the Supervisory \nBoard and the involvement of the Group Works Council in relevant \ndecision-making processes directly incorporate the interests of em-\nployees and enable the alignment of management strategies with \ntheir needs. Many communication and dialogue formats (e.g.'), Document(id='738094f1-06b0-49db-a5e2-cf4d6564a344', metadata={'source': '269', 'page': '107'}, page_content='at least one material impact, material risk or material opportunity \nhas been identified for the respective sustainability matter.

Continental’s general remuneration processes include the involve-\nment of employee representatives and the consideration of bench-\nmarks. These measures create a basis for preventing inadequate \nwages. In addition, further specific preventive and remedial \nmeasures for the legal entities are defined in respective rules. This \nincludes, for example, regularly checking whether payments com-\nply with national and local legislation, clearly communicating remu-\nneration principles to employees, ensuring timely and regular pay-\nments and reviewing and updating appropriate benchmarks. Monitoring is carried out through the annual review process of the \nRVCDDS, in which the Executive Board is informed of the current \nstatus and decides on the effectiveness, adequacy and potential for \nimprovement. The effectiveness of the management approach can \nalso be measured by the metric for adequate wages. The RVCDDS is formalized by a dedicated rule. Other rules define \nthe specific aspects for fair payment and adequate wages. With its management approach, Continental follows the internationally \nrecognized standards and frameworks on human rights and labor \nstandards, as described in more detail in the management approach \nto labor standards, as well as the applicable local laws on wages. The most important stakeholder perspective to be considered in \nthe management approach to adequate wages is the perspective \nof employees. To obtain this, the regular Employee Survey OUR BA-\nSICS Live includes dedicated questions on the topic of remunera-\ntion and recognition, with a special focus on fair payment. Remu-\nneration models are discussed with the involvement of the respec-\ntive works councils or employee representatives to ensure the con-\nsideration of employees’ interests.

To incorporate stakeholder interests into the management system, \nContinental has established various formats. These include specific \nworkshops and conferences, which are defined as measures by the \nlabor standards rules. Another format is the regular Employee Sur-\nvey OUR BASICS Live in which Continental’s employees are asked \nabout different topics related to Continental’s values. The integra-\ntion of these interests into the system is carried out as part of the \nannual review process. To ensure a comprehensive understanding and engagement related \nto labor standards within the organization, Continental communi-\ncates the management approach through diverse channels.

These are described at the \nbeginning of the section. These negative impacts are linked to \nContinental’s strategy and business model and relate in particular \nto countries, certain markets and industries of the supplier base \nand Continental’s own operations, which are exposed to such im-\npacts to a critical or significant extent. The development of measures and strategic decisions based on \nthe impacts identified is described in this sustainability report as \npart of the management approaches Environmental protection in \nown operations, Environmental protection in the supply chain, and \nSubstances of concern and very high concern in the Pollution \n(ESRS E2) section as well as Labor standards in the Own workforce \n(ESRS S1) section and in the Workers in the value chain (ESRS S2) \nsection. The identified risk is not related to a dependency on affected com-\nmunities, but rather to geographical and industry-related aspects. As indicated by the description, it results directly from the identified \npotential impacts and is also based on the breadth and diversity of \ncountries, markets and industries in Continental’s own operations \nand supplier base. The risk is therefore inherently linked to Continental’s strategy and \nbusiness model. As Continental sources goods, materials and services from numer-\nous industries along the value chain, this essentially has potential \nimpacts on all types of affected communities. Communities living \nor working near Continental sites or near to companies in Conti-\nnental’s supply chain are considered to be particularly affected. In \nboth cases, this also includes indigenous people. The impacts on \ncommunities in the downstream value chain are rather considered \nas indirect. Continental’s assessment of the impacts, risks and opportunities \ndid not focus on affected communities with specific characteristics \nor in specific activities and contexts, and accordingly did not pro-\nvide an understanding of specific exposure to harm. The assessment of the material negative impacts regarding own \nworkforce was integrated in the general impact, risk and oppor-\ntunity assessment following the defined methodology. All negative impacts are considered widespread or systemic as \nthey relate to countries, certain markets and industries in Conti-\nnental’s own operations or supplier base. In addition, the methodol-\nogy takes into account event-based actual negative impacts wher-\never the impact description contains a reference to concrete actual \nincidents.

These are subdivided into \nthe following areas: labor standards, adequate wages, work-life bal-\nance, training and skill development, secure employment and social \ndialogue, employee privacy, and occupational safety and health. Labor standards \nContinental has defined an approach for the management of labor \nstandards for its own workforce that is intended to prevent and re-\nduce actual and potential negative impacts and risks as well as \nstrengthen positive impacts with regard to working time, discrimi-\nnation, forced labor and child labor as well as other human rights \nand working conditions. This is part of the “Responsible Value \nChain Due Diligence System” (RVCDDS). Continental is thus pursuing the ambition of creating good work-\ning conditions and a 100 % responsible value chain by 2050 at \nthe latest. As part of the RVCDDS, Continental has adopted so-\ncalled Responsible Value Chain Commitments (RVC commit-\nments), which include the following for the area of labor stand-\nards: no child labor, fair payment, equal treatment, no forced la-\nbor or modern slavery, freedom of association and working con-\nditions, including working time. With the specific RVC commitment for equal treatment, Continental \nstrives for a working environment that is free from discrimination, \nincluding harassment, in any form. This is an integral part of the \nmanagement system and is supported by dedicated diversity man-\nagement aimed at promoting equal opportunities and advancing \ndiversity and inclusion.'), Document(id='9cab7b4c-4273-4afc-a1e6-159a3642ea94', metadata={'source': '438', 'page': '173'}, page_content='The descriptions of the IROs are to be regarded as self-contained, \nwhich may result in repetitions. Labor standards \n› In 2024, Continental recorded individual incidents related to \nworking time in its own workforce.

With the RVC commitments, the RVCDDS explicitly addresses re-\nspect for human rights, particularly with the RVC commitments in \nthe area of labor standards. The safety of workers, precarious working conditions, trafficking in \nhuman beings, forced labor (including debt bondage) and child la-\nbor are also addressed by Continental’s RVC commitments and \nBusiness Partner Code of Conduct.

As described in the methodology of the IRO assessment, Conti-\nnental used a variety of input parameters to evaluate the IROs, in-\ncluding both quantitative and qualitative data sources such as met-\nrics, internal reports, and external market research. Continental has defined the following time intervals for potential \nimpacts, risks and opportunities following the ESRS requirements: \n› “Short-term” is coherent with the reporting period in the consoli-\ndated financial statements (up to one year). › “Medium-term” corresponds to a period between the end of the \nshort- period and up to five years. › “Long-term” is defined by a period of more than five years.

These include the internationally recog-\nnized conventions on human rights, such as the United Nations \nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Continental’s management approach to respect for human rights \nand labor standards is also in line with the key points of the Interna-\ntional Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization \n(ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work \nand the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These com-\nmitments serve as a global minimum standard for all Continental \nlocations and form the basis for compliance with local laws and \nregulations. Additionally, Continental is a signatory of initiatives like \nthe German Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter). The company \nalso endorses the Women’s Empowerment Principles established \nby the UN Global Compact and UN Women, demonstrating its dedi-\ncation to promoting diversity and inclusion across its operations. Monitoring of the adherence to these standards is anchored in the \nRVCDDS review process, including a revision of its rules and pro-\ncesses, if required. To incorporate stakeholder interests into the management system, \nContinental has established various formats. These include specific \nworkshops and conferences, which are defined as measures by the \nlabor standards rules. Another format is the regular Employee Sur-\nvey OUR BASICS Live in which Continental’s employees are asked \nabout different topics related to Continental’s values. The integra-\ntion of these interests into the system is carried out as part of the \nannual review process. To ensure a comprehensive understanding and engagement related \nto labor standards within the organization, Continental communi-\ncates the management approach through diverse channels. This in-\ncludes our website and internal communication platforms which \nhost trainings as well as the frameworks. In addition, posters and on-\nsite training courses make relevant information available to employ-\nees who do not have access to the IT infrastructure. Furthermore, \nthrough integration into the onboarding process, new employees \nare also familiarized with these standards right from the start. Furthermore, stakeholders involved in implementing the manage-\nment approach have clearly defined roles within the RVCDDS and \nare trained on the associated responsibilities to enable effective col-\nlaboration and execution of the management approach. Adequate wages \nWith its management approach to adequate wages, Continental \naims to provide fair pay for all employees, as anchored in the RVC \ncommitments.

In compliance with local laws and regulations, em-\nployees shall be compensated for overtime in a reasonable way. Deductions from wages as a disciplinary measure shall not be per-\nmitted. For each pay period, employees shall be provided with a \ntimely and understandable wage statement that includes sufficient \ninformation to verify accurate compensation for work performed.

The management approach directly covers Continental’s own em-\nployees, while the RVC commitments also include non-employees. Overall accountability for the RVCDDS, including the RVC commit-\nments for labor standards, lies with the Executive Board. The latter \nhas appointed a human rights officer who manages the system. The specific human relations (HR) frameworks for labor standards \nare defined and implemented by the respective HR departments \nalong the company structure. Responsibility for the implementation \nof the labor standards lies with the management of the respective \nlegal entities. The system is comprised of many processes that include strategy \ndevelopment and implementation, the management of regulations, \nimpact and risk management, incident management (including \nwhistleblowing) and training. In order to monitor the effectiveness \nof the system, a multi-stage process has been set up based on the \n“three lines” model. The first line is formed by the local operational \nHR departments. They implement the operational tasks at business \nlevel and at the location in accordance with the RVCDDS and the \nassociated HR rules. The second line, represented by non-opera-\ntional HR departments and roles, oversees the system, roles and re-\nsponsibilities as well as their effectiveness. The third line is Conti-\nnental’s internal audit function, which performs an independent \nevaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the RVCDDS. Specific preventive and remedial measures are defined for the re-\nspective RVC commitments for the area of labor standards, which \nare implemented by the legal entities, such as self-assessments, the \nimplementation of appropriate rules and instructions, the careful \nanalysis of the working environment with regard to aspects that \ncould cause harm, the implementation of improvement measures \nand control mechanisms, as well as raising awareness, especially \namong managers. With regard to working time, Continental implemented further dedi-\ncated processes with regard to flexible working models as stated in \ndetail in the management approach to work-life balance. As part of an annual review process with the Executive Board, the \nentire RVCDDS, including the specific processes for labor standards \nin own operations, is evaluated in terms of effectiveness, adequacy \nand potential for improvement.

incident management (including whistleblowing) \nand training, as well as the “three lines” model for system control. Continental’s general remuneration processes include the involve-\nment of employee representatives and the consideration of bench-\nmarks. These measures create a basis for preventing inadequate \nwages. In addition, further specific preventive and remedial \nmeasures for the legal entities are defined in respective rules. This \nincludes, for example, regularly checking whether payments com-\nply with national and local legislation, clearly communicating remu-\nneration principles to employees, ensuring timely and regular pay-\nments and reviewing and updating appropriate benchmarks. Monitoring is carried out through the annual review process of the \nRVCDDS, in which the Executive Board is informed of the current \nstatus and decides on the effectiveness, adequacy and potential for \nimprovement. The effectiveness of the management approach can \nalso be measured by the metric for adequate wages. The RVCDDS is formalized by a dedicated rule. Other rules define \nthe specific aspects for fair payment and adequate wages. With its management approach, Continental follows the internationally \nrecognized standards and frameworks on human rights and labor \nstandards, as described in more detail in the management approach \nto labor standards, as well as the applicable local laws on wages. The most important stakeholder perspective to be considered in \nthe management approach to adequate wages is the perspective \nof employees. To obtain this, the regular Employee Survey OUR BA-\nSICS Live includes dedicated questions on the topic of remunera-\ntion and recognition, with a special focus on fair payment. Remu-\nneration models are discussed with the involvement of the respec-\ntive works councils or employee representatives to ensure the con-\nsideration of employees’ interests. Specific cases of inadequate \nwages can also be reported through the integrity system.

The integrity channels can be accessed through our website or via an \ninternational phone hotline and are explicitly also open for workers in \nthe value chain. They are available worldwide in many different lan-\nguages and accessible 24/7, creating broad availability by overcom-\ning barriers such as time zones or languages. The integrity system is governed by a dedicated rule that defines roles \nand responsibilities along the process steps of reporting, report ad-\nministration and substantiation, investigation, and sanctioning – in an \nend-to-end process.

To gain insights into the interests of workers \nin the value chain, Continental maintains partnerships and is in-\nvolved in associations such as econsense, the Responsible Busi-\nness Alliance (RBA), Rubberway, “Deutsche Gesellschaft für Interna-\ntionale Zusammenarbeit” (GIZ) (German Agency for International \nCooperation) and the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rub-\nber (GPSNR). The integration of these interests into the system is \ncarried out as part of the annual review process. Continental communicates its management approach through the \nexternally published RVC commitments and the Public Policy \nStatement. Training initiatives for suppliers are also carried out to \nfurther promote shared responsibility along the entire value chain. In addition, direct suppliers are requested to sign the Business \nPartner Code of Conduct. The communication is thus aimed at af-\nfected stakeholders as well as stakeholders involved in the imple-\nmentation. Processes for engaging with value chain workers about \nimpacts \nThe engagement with workers in the value chain is part of the con-\ntinuous development of the management approach described. A key element of this is the participation in dialogue formats of  \nassociations and initiatives with external stakeholders, such as the \nsector dialogue for the automotive industry and the dialogue with \nlabor unions. Participation in and maintenance of these dialogue \nformats take place on a continuous basis. If required, topic- or \nevent-specific discussions take place. The knowledge thus gained \nabout the interests of workers in the value chain supports the  \ndevelopment of a shared understanding of industry-related risks \nand impacts on stakeholders and the resulting due diligence  \nobligations. The processes and activities regarding the detection and mitigation \nof negative impacts are managed through the RVCDDS and also \ninclude cases that are reported by workers in the value chain via \nContinental’s integrity system. The integrity system is described in \nmore detail in the subsection Processes to remediate negative  \nimpacts and channels for workers in the value chain to raise con-\ncerns in this section. This is a form of direct engagement with af-\nfected stakeholders, in addition to the participation in initiatives \nand associations. Governance and responsibility for the processes are regulated \nwithin the RVCDDS as described in the management approach. The \nannual review process anchored in the RVCDDS includes a consoli-\ndation and analysis of relevant information. As an integral part of \nthis, the actual negative impacts identified via the bottom-up im-\npact and risk analysis, as well as case management, are reviewed, \nand the effectiveness of the established processes is monitored. The engagement with particularly vulnerable workers in the value \nchain is addressed mostly indirectly, e.g. by the RVC commitment \non equal treatment. Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for \nworkers in the value chain to raise concerns \n \nGrievance channels for value chain workers \nContinental has established dedicated mechanisms to enable workers \nin the value chain to raise concerns. These are part of a comprehensive integrity system that comprises \nthree channels: an integrity portal, an integrity hotline and an integrity \ne-mail address, as described in more detail in the Business conduct \nand corporate governance (ESRS G1) section. Employees as well as \nthird parties outside the Continental Group can report violations of le-\ngal regulations, fundamental values and ethical standards via these \nchannels. The platform and hotline are managed by an external ser-\nvice provider, while the integrity e-mail is managed directly by a Conti-\nnental case management team. The integrity channels can be accessed through our website or via an \ninternational phone hotline and are explicitly also open for workers in \nthe value chain. They are available worldwide in many different lan-\nguages and accessible 24/7, creating broad availability by overcom-\ning barriers such as time zones or languages. The integrity system is governed by a dedicated rule that defines roles \nand responsibilities along the process steps of reporting, report ad-\nministration and substantiation, investigation, and sanctioning – in an \nend-to-end process. The case management is also subject to internal \naudits. In addition, Continental’s publicly available rules of procedure \nprovide transparency on the handling of cases.

In addition, \nContinental has established a variety of formats for social dialogue \nand employee engagement, including townhall meetings, networks, \nopen calls and online platforms. This foundation for social dialogue \nis also the basis for managing employment matters in the transition \nof our industries. With regard to secure employment, Continental has established a \nset of processes, projects and measures. They mitigate the nega-\ntive impacts of the transformation on employees and simultane-\nously create positive effects in terms of the creation of jobs and up-\nskilling. › In contract design, the focus is on providing employees with long-\nterm offers. Flexible working time, mobile work options, and other \nbenefits regarding employee working conditions, as described in \nthe management approaches to work-life balance and adequate \nwages, are intended to proactively reduce employee turnover. › With regard to the impacts of the transformation, Continental has \ncreated a range of opportunities to prepare employees for the job \nmarket of the future. These are set out in the management ap-\nproach to training and skill development. › Job changes are also supported through a global internal job \nmarket. › Especially in Germany, which is significantly affected by transfor-\nmation processes - for example, due to increasing digitalization \nand technological change – Continental has established pro-\ncesses to support employees in external job transitions to other \nemployers that offer better employment opportunities at the re-\nspective location (“von Arbeit in Arbeit”). These processes also in-\nclude discussions with potential external employers. The effectiveness of the management approach is monitored via \ndedicated feedback channels, HR processes and the reported metrics \n“Percentage of employees covered by employee representation”, \n“Employee turnover” and the OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engage-\nment index. The processes are regulated through Continental’s internal HR rules \nand by-laws as well as agreements with works councils. Key aspects regarding secure employment and social dialogue are \nregulated in particular by local laws, regulations and regulatory pro-\nvisions. By definition, social dialogue is an interest-based exchange with \nemployees and their representatives. In order to gain further in-\nsights and consider the interests of its own workforce in the man-\nagement approach, Continental uses its internal communication \nchannels and has integrated feedback processes into various en-\ngagement formats and training courses. An additional formalized \nprocess is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey, which gathers \nthe employee’s opinions and views on various topics related to \nContinental’s values. These are recorded, consolidated and ana-\nlyzed in an established process.

Continental’s general remuneration processes include the involve-\nment of employee representatives and the consideration of bench-\nmarks. These measures create a basis for preventing inadequate \nwages. In addition, further specific preventive and remedial \nmeasures for the legal entities are defined in respective rules. This \nincludes, for example, regularly checking whether payments com-\nply with national and local legislation, clearly communicating remu-\nneration principles to employees, ensuring timely and regular pay-\nments and reviewing and updating appropriate benchmarks. Monitoring is carried out through the annual review process of the \nRVCDDS, in which the Executive Board is informed of the current \nstatus and decides on the effectiveness, adequacy and potential for \nimprovement. The effectiveness of the management approach can \nalso be measured by the metric for adequate wages. The RVCDDS is formalized by a dedicated rule. Other rules define \nthe specific aspects for fair payment and adequate wages. With its management approach, Continental follows the internationally \nrecognized standards and frameworks on human rights and labor \nstandards, as described in more detail in the management approach \nto labor standards, as well as the applicable local laws on wages. The most important stakeholder perspective to be considered in \nthe management approach to adequate wages is the perspective \nof employees. To obtain this, the regular Employee Survey OUR BA-\nSICS Live includes dedicated questions on the topic of remunera-\ntion and recognition, with a special focus on fair payment. Remu-\nneration models are discussed with the involvement of the respec-\ntive works councils or employee representatives to ensure the con-\nsideration of employees’ interests.

These are subdivided into \nthe following areas: labor standards, adequate wages, work-life bal-\nance, training and skill development, secure employment and social \ndialogue, employee privacy, and occupational safety and health. Labor standards \nContinental has defined an approach for the management of labor \nstandards for its own workforce that is intended to prevent and re-\nduce actual and potential negative impacts and risks as well as \nstrengthen positive impacts with regard to working time, discrimi-\nnation, forced labor and child labor as well as other human rights \nand working conditions. This is part of the “Responsible Value \nChain Due Diligence System” (RVCDDS). Continental is thus pursuing the ambition of creating good work-\ning conditions and a 100 % responsible value chain by 2050 at \nthe latest. As part of the RVCDDS, Continental has adopted so-\ncalled Responsible Value Chain Commitments (RVC commit-\nments), which include the following for the area of labor stand-\nards: no child labor, fair payment, equal treatment, no forced la-\nbor or modern slavery, freedom of association and working con-\nditions, including working time. With the specific RVC commitment for equal treatment, Continental \nstrives for a working environment that is free from discrimination, \nincluding harassment, in any form. This is an integral part of the \nmanagement system and is supported by dedicated diversity man-\nagement aimed at promoting equal opportunities and advancing \ndiversity and inclusion.'), Document(id='46ca81d6-de51-4ec3-bc13-0f85d0107b89', metadata={'source': '468', 'page': '184'}, page_content=' \n \n \nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \n181\nTargets Related to Own Workforce \nWith regard to its own workforce, Continental has set itself a time-\nbound target related to the matters diversity and gender equality. Continental counts on the diversity of its employees. By this we \nmean internationality, a balanced gender ratio, and a range of expe-\nriences and age categories. Diversity is a key driver for different \nperspectives within the organization and thereby promotes the re-\nsilience in decision making. In addition, promoting diversity espe-\ncially on leadership level is also considered to support the preven-\ntion of discrimination and harassment in the organization. We have \nset ourselves the public sustainability target of increasing the share \nof female executives and senior executives to up to 30 % by 2030. An interim target on the trajectory for the target for 2030 is the \nshare of 25 % female executives and senior executives by 2025. The scope of the target comprises all management positions (sen-\nior executives and executives) worldwide. This target addresses the overall leadership culture of the company \nand especially the impacts and risks related to equal treatment and \ncombating discrimination, as described in the management ap-\nproach Labor standards in this section. Indirectly it also addresses \ntopics such as adequate wages and skill development. The progress of the target achievement is measured with the met-\nric on gender diversity – share of female and male senior execu-\ntives and executives. This metric is monitored continuously and reported at least once a \nyear. The metric slightly increased in the reporting year to about \n20.5 % compared to about 19.9 % in the previous year. It is thereby \nstill within the expected range of the target achievement curve. The target was defined based on different internal calculations, tak-\ning into account the related challenges as well as potential. The \nmetric is calculated based on a defined methodology and has al-\nready been reported for several years. Continental has set up a dedicated HR community in where HR \nmanagers can exchange best practices and insights between differ-\nent teams across the organizational levels. It serves to tailor initia-\ntives to specific needs and promote the continuous improvement \nof Continental’s overall diversity and inclusion efforts. Employee representatives were actively involved in the target-set-\nting process. The involvement of the affected interest groups, the identification \nof lessons learned and potential for improvement, e.g. via networks, \nis presented in the key actions for target achievement.'), Document(id='9ad0bed0-2116-45f3-843e-1f30911956a5', metadata={'source': '448', 'page': '177'}, page_content=""They are complemented by special \nprocesses that are focused on diversity and belonging. Additionally, \nthe respect for human rights and fair working conditions are em-\nbedded in Continental's Code of Conduct, which forms the basis for \ncollaboration among all our employees. Continental’s management approach to respect for human rights \nand labor standards is in line with both international frameworks as \nwell as local regulations. These include the internationally recog-\nnized conventions on human rights, such as the United Nations \nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Continental’s management approach to respect for human rights \nand labor standards is also in line with the key points of the Interna-\ntional Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization \n(ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work \nand the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These com-\nmitments serve as a global minimum standard for all Continental \nlocations and form the basis for compliance with local laws and \nregulations. Additionally, Continental is a signatory of initiatives like \nthe German Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter). The company \nalso endorses the Women’s Empowerment Principles established \nby the UN Global Compact and UN Women, demonstrating its dedi-\ncation to promoting diversity and inclusion across its operations. Monitoring of the adherence to these standards is anchored in the \nRVCDDS review process, including a revision of its rules and pro-\ncesses, if required. To incorporate stakeholder interests into the management system, \nContinental has established various formats. These include specific \nworkshops and conferences, which are defined as measures by the \nlabor standards rules. Another format is the regular Employee Sur-\nvey OUR BASICS Live in which Continental’s employees are asked \nabout different topics related to Continental’s values. The integra-\ntion of these interests into the system is carried out as part of the \nannual review process. To ensure a comprehensive understanding and engagement related \nto labor standards within the organization, Continental communi-\ncates the management approach through diverse channels. This in-\ncludes our website and internal communication platforms which \nhost trainings as well as the frameworks. In addition, posters and on-\nsite training courses make relevant information available to employ-\nees who do not have access to the IT infrastructure. Furthermore, \nthrough integration into the onboarding process, new employees \nare also familiarized with these standards right from the start. Furthermore, stakeholders involved in implementing the manage-\nment approach have clearly defined roles within the RVCDDS and \nare trained on the associated responsibilities to enable effective col-\nlaboration and execution of the management approach. Adequate wages \nWith its management approach to adequate wages, Continental \naims to provide fair pay for all employees, as anchored in the RVC \ncommitments. In those, Continental has formulated the commit-\nment that compensation paid to employees shall comply with all \napplicable wage laws and regulations, including those relating to \nminimum wages, living wages, overtime hours, and legally man-\ndated benefits. In compliance with local laws and regulations, em-\nployees shall be compensated for overtime in a reasonable way. Deductions from wages as a disciplinary measure shall not be per-\nmitted. For each pay period, employees shall be provided with a \ntimely and understandable wage statement that includes sufficient \ninformation to verify accurate compensation for work performed. The management approach covers Continental’s own employees, \nwhile the RVC commitment also includes non-employees.

In addition, \nContinental has established a variety of formats for social dialogue \nand employee engagement, including townhall meetings, networks, \nopen calls and online platforms. This foundation for social dialogue \nis also the basis for managing employment matters in the transition \nof our industries. With regard to secure employment, Continental has established a \nset of processes, projects and measures. They mitigate the nega-\ntive impacts of the transformation on employees and simultane-\nously create positive effects in terms of the creation of jobs and up-\nskilling. › In contract design, the focus is on providing employees with long-\nterm offers. Flexible working time, mobile work options, and other \nbenefits regarding employee working conditions, as described in \nthe management approaches to work-life balance and adequate \nwages, are intended to proactively reduce employee turnover. › With regard to the impacts of the transformation, Continental has \ncreated a range of opportunities to prepare employees for the job \nmarket of the future. These are set out in the management ap-\nproach to training and skill development. › Job changes are also supported through a global internal job \nmarket. › Especially in Germany, which is significantly affected by transfor-\nmation processes - for example, due to increasing digitalization \nand technological change – Continental has established pro-\ncesses to support employees in external job transitions to other \nemployers that offer better employment opportunities at the re-\nspective location (“von Arbeit in Arbeit”). These processes also in-\nclude discussions with potential external employers. The effectiveness of the management approach is monitored via \ndedicated feedback channels, HR processes and the reported metrics \n“Percentage of employees covered by employee representation”, \n“Employee turnover” and the OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engage-\nment index. The processes are regulated through Continental’s internal HR rules \nand by-laws as well as agreements with works councils. Key aspects regarding secure employment and social dialogue are \nregulated in particular by local laws, regulations and regulatory pro-\nvisions. By definition, social dialogue is an interest-based exchange with \nemployees and their representatives. In order to gain further in-\nsights and consider the interests of its own workforce in the man-\nagement approach, Continental uses its internal communication \nchannels and has integrated feedback processes into various en-\ngagement formats and training courses.

Continental’s general remuneration processes include the involve-\nment of employee representatives and the consideration of bench-\nmarks. These measures create a basis for preventing inadequate \nwages. In addition, further specific preventive and remedial \nmeasures for the legal entities are defined in respective rules. This \nincludes, for example, regularly checking whether payments com-\nply with national and local legislation, clearly communicating remu-\nneration principles to employees, ensuring timely and regular pay-\nments and reviewing and updating appropriate benchmarks. Monitoring is carried out through the annual review process of the \nRVCDDS, in which the Executive Board is informed of the current \nstatus and decides on the effectiveness, adequacy and potential for \nimprovement. The effectiveness of the management approach can \nalso be measured by the metric for adequate wages. The RVCDDS is formalized by a dedicated rule. Other rules define \nthe specific aspects for fair payment and adequate wages. With its management approach, Continental follows the internationally \nrecognized standards and frameworks on human rights and labor \nstandards, as described in more detail in the management approach \nto labor standards, as well as the applicable local laws on wages. The most important stakeholder perspective to be considered in \nthe management approach to adequate wages is the perspective \nof employees. To obtain this, the regular Employee Survey OUR BA-\nSICS Live includes dedicated questions on the topic of remunera-\ntion and recognition, with a special focus on fair payment.

The integration of these interests into the system is \ncarried out as part of the annual review process. Continental communicates its management approach through the \nexternally published RVC commitments and the Public Policy \nStatement. Training initiatives for suppliers are also carried out to \nfurther promote shared responsibility along the entire value chain. In addition, direct suppliers are requested to sign the Business \nPartner Code of Conduct. The communication is thus aimed at af-\nfected stakeholders as well as stakeholders involved in the imple-\nmentation. Processes for engaging with value chain workers about \nimpacts \nThe engagement with workers in the value chain is part of the con-\ntinuous development of the management approach described. A key element of this is the participation in dialogue formats of  \nassociations and initiatives with external stakeholders, such as the \nsector dialogue for the automotive industry and the dialogue with \nlabor unions. Participation in and maintenance of these dialogue \nformats take place on a continuous basis. If required, topic- or \nevent-specific discussions take place. The knowledge thus gained \nabout the interests of workers in the value chain supports the  \ndevelopment of a shared understanding of industry-related risks \nand impacts on stakeholders and the resulting due diligence  \nobligations. The processes and activities regarding the detection and mitigation \nof negative impacts are managed through the RVCDDS and also \ninclude cases that are reported by workers in the value chain via \nContinental’s integrity system. The integrity system is described in \nmore detail in the subsection Processes to remediate negative  \nimpacts and channels for workers in the value chain to raise con-\ncerns in this section. This is a form of direct engagement with af-\nfected stakeholders, in addition to the participation in initiatives \nand associations. Governance and responsibility for the processes are regulated \nwithin the RVCDDS as described in the management approach. The \nannual review process anchored in the RVCDDS includes a consoli-\ndation and analysis of relevant information. As an integral part of \nthis, the actual negative impacts identified via the bottom-up im-\npact and risk analysis, as well as case management, are reviewed, \nand the effectiveness of the established processes is monitored.

Accountability for the safety and health management approach lies \nwith the management of the respective legal entities, as legally re-\nquired in most countries. Furthermore, individual accountability \nplays a crucial role, as every supervisor and employee has a per-\nsonal responsibility to uphold safety and health practices in their re-\nspective function. The framework for safety and health is defined \nby the safety and health organization, which also provides support \nwith its implementation.

Continental is thus pursuing the ambition of creating good work-\ning conditions and a 100 % responsible value chain by 2050 at \nthe latest. As part of the RVCDDS, Continental has adopted so-\ncalled Responsible Value Chain Commitments (RVC commit-\nments), which include the following for the area of labor stand-\nards: no child labor, fair payment, equal treatment, no forced la-\nbor or modern slavery, freedom of association and working con-\nditions, including working time. With the specific RVC commitment for equal treatment, Continental \nstrives for a working environment that is free from discrimination, \nincluding harassment, in any form.

The focus of the management approaches and the RVCDDS in par-\nticular is on own operations and direct suppliers, and therefore on \naffected communities in their vicinity. Indirectly and on an ad hoc \nbasis, the deeper supply chain is also taken into account. Specific \nelements of the RVCDDS, in particular the integrity system and the \nassociated case management, are aimed directly at all affected \ncommunities along the value chain. As part of the RVCDDS, in addition to the RVC commitments de-\nscribed in the management approaches mentioned, Continental \ncommits to respect legitimate land rights throughout the entire life \ncycle of a property or other use of land, forests and water, espe-\ncially where these secure the livelihoods of people.

These processes also in-\nclude discussions with potential external employers. The effectiveness of the management approach is monitored via \ndedicated feedback channels, HR processes and the reported metrics \n“Percentage of employees covered by employee representation”, \n“Employee turnover” and the OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engage-\nment index. The processes are regulated through Continental’s internal HR rules \nand by-laws as well as agreements with works councils. Key aspects regarding secure employment and social dialogue are \nregulated in particular by local laws, regulations and regulatory pro-\nvisions. By definition, social dialogue is an interest-based exchange with \nemployees and their representatives. In order to gain further in-\nsights and consider the interests of its own workforce in the man-\nagement approach, Continental uses its internal communication \nchannels and has integrated feedback processes into various en-\ngagement formats and training courses.

These include the internationally recog-\nnized conventions on human rights, such as the United Nations \nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Continental’s management approach to respect for human rights \nand labor standards is also in line with the key points of the Interna-\ntional Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization \n(ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work \nand the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These com-\nmitments serve as a global minimum standard for all Continental \nlocations and form the basis for compliance with local laws and \nregulations. Additionally, Continental is a signatory of initiatives like \nthe German Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter). The company \nalso endorses the Women’s Empowerment Principles established \nby the UN Global Compact and UN Women, demonstrating its dedi-\ncation to promoting diversity and inclusion across its operations. Monitoring of the adherence to these standards is anchored in the \nRVCDDS review process, including a revision of its rules and pro-\ncesses, if required. To incorporate stakeholder interests into the management system, \nContinental has established various formats. These include specific \nworkshops and conferences, which are defined as measures by the \nlabor standards rules. Another format is the regular Employee Sur-\nvey OUR BASICS Live in which Continental’s employees are asked \nabout different topics related to Continental’s values. The integra-\ntion of these interests into the system is carried out as part of the \nannual review process. To ensure a comprehensive understanding and engagement related \nto labor standards within the organization, Continental communi-\ncates the management approach through diverse channels. This in-\ncludes our website and internal communication platforms which \nhost trainings as well as the frameworks. In addition, posters and on-\nsite training courses make relevant information available to employ-\nees who do not have access to the IT infrastructure. Furthermore, \nthrough integration into the onboarding process, new employees \nare also familiarized with these standards right from the start. Furthermore, stakeholders involved in implementing the manage-\nment approach have clearly defined roles within the RVCDDS and \nare trained on the associated responsibilities to enable effective col-\nlaboration and execution of the management approach. Adequate wages \nWith its management approach to adequate wages, Continental \naims to provide fair pay for all employees, as anchored in the RVC \ncommitments. In those, Continental has formulated the commit-\nment that compensation paid to employees shall comply with all \napplicable wage laws and regulations, including those relating to \nminimum wages, living wages, overtime hours, and legally man-\ndated benefits. In compliance with local laws and regulations, em-\nployees shall be compensated for overtime in a reasonable way. Deductions from wages as a disciplinary measure shall not be per-\nmitted. For each pay period, employees shall be provided with a \ntimely and understandable wage statement that includes sufficient \ninformation to verify accurate compensation for work performed. The management approach covers Continental’s own employees, \nwhile the RVC commitment also includes non-employees. Overall accountability for the management approach lies with the \nExecutive Board.""), Document(id='4f1bfe00-23be-466a-935e-8a510995fbb0', metadata={'source': '470', 'page': '184'}, page_content='events, of-\nfers for talent management and development as well as networks.

The management approach directly covers Continental’s own em-\nployees, while the RVC commitments also include non-employees. Overall accountability for the RVCDDS, including the RVC commit-\nments for labor standards, lies with the Executive Board. The latter \nhas appointed a human rights officer who manages the system.

In order to monitor the effectiveness \nof the system, a multi-stage process has been set up based on the \n“three lines” model. The first line is formed by the local operational \nHR departments. They implement the operational tasks at business \nlevel and at the location in accordance with the RVCDDS and the \nassociated HR rules. The second line, represented by non-opera-\ntional HR departments and roles, oversees the system, roles and re-\nsponsibilities as well as their effectiveness.

Formalized processes especially include the rep-\nresentation of employees by works councils or similar structures as \nwell as the regular employee survey OUR BASICS Live. In addition, \nContinental has established a variety of formats for social dialogue \nand employee engagement, including townhall meetings, networks, \nopen calls and online platforms. This foundation for social dialogue \nis also the basis for managing employment matters in the transition \nof our industries. With regard to secure employment, Continental has established a \nset of processes, projects and measures. They mitigate the nega-\ntive impacts of the transformation on employees and simultane-\nously create positive effects in terms of the creation of jobs and up-\nskilling. › In contract design, the focus is on providing employees with long-\nterm offers. Flexible working time, mobile work options, and other \nbenefits regarding employee working conditions, as described in \nthe management approaches to work-life balance and adequate \nwages, are intended to proactively reduce employee turnover. › With regard to the impacts of the transformation, Continental has \ncreated a range of opportunities to prepare employees for the job \nmarket of the future. These are set out in the management ap-\nproach to training and skill development. › Job changes are also supported through a global internal job \nmarket. › Especially in Germany, which is significantly affected by transfor-\nmation processes - for example, due to increasing digitalization \nand technological change – Continental has established pro-\ncesses to support employees in external job transitions to other \nemployers that offer better employment opportunities at the re-\nspective location (“von Arbeit in Arbeit”). These processes also in-\nclude discussions with potential external employers. The effectiveness of the management approach is monitored via \ndedicated feedback channels, HR processes and the reported metrics \n“Percentage of employees covered by employee representation”, \n“Employee turnover” and the OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engage-\nment index. The processes are regulated through Continental’s internal HR rules \nand by-laws as well as agreements with works councils. Key aspects regarding secure employment and social dialogue are \nregulated in particular by local laws, regulations and regulatory pro-\nvisions. By definition, social dialogue is an interest-based exchange with \nemployees and their representatives. In order to gain further in-\nsights and consider the interests of its own workforce in the man-\nagement approach, Continental uses its internal communication \nchannels and has integrated feedback processes into various en-\ngagement formats and training courses. An additional formalized \nprocess is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey, which gathers \nthe employee’s opinions and views on various topics related to \nContinental’s values. These are recorded, consolidated and ana-\nlyzed in an established process. Furthermore, co-determination \npractices such as employee representation on the Supervisory \nBoard and the involvement of the Group Works Council in relevant \ndecision-making processes directly incorporate the interests of em-\nployees and enable the alignment of management strategies with \ntheir needs. Many communication and dialogue formats (e.g.'), Document(id='0500e706-1157-4a56-8af7-663a73b3c212', metadata={'source': '442', 'page': '175'}, page_content='The identified actual and potential impacts on own workforce are \nimportant for adapting the strategy and business model.

Through careful planning and execution of \nits transition strategies, the Group aims to balance its environmental \ncommitments with the well-being and development of its workforce. Risks and opportunities arising from impacts \nand dependencies on own workforce\nWorking conditions\nThe Group identifies operational risks such as strikes, loss of \nproductivity, and resignations as potential risks. Legal risks include \npotential fines from lawsuits, duty of care infringement, and \nnon-compliance with mandatory benefit requirements and \nworkplace violations, which could lead to a loss of business. Reputational risks arise from NGO demands on freedom of \nassociation and media exposure. Social negotiations may increase \noperational costs. Conversely, the Group recognizes the \nopportunity to enhance its reputation and attract talent by \nmaintaining decent working conditions, which is crucial for \nnurturing and retaining talent within the organization. Employee health and safety\nThe Group is aware of the legal risks associated with potential fines \ndue to non-compliance with health and safety regulations. Civil \nrisks may emerge from potential claims by employees or \ncustomers, and reputational risks could result from any damage to \nthe Group’s image, particularly when incidents involve employees \nworking on client sites. Equal treatment and opportunities for all\nThe Group sees a business opportunity in increasing employee \nengagement, which can lead to improved productivity rates. Not \ninvesting in skills development poses a risk, as the organization \nmay lack the necessary competencies to meet business needs. Being perceived as an ethical company enhances the Group’s \nemployer brand and aids in attracting and retaining talents. However, there is a legal risk associated with potential lawsuits \narising from discrimination cases. Training and skills development\nInvesting in training and skills development is seen as a key factor \nin employee attraction and retention, contributing to productivity \nimprovement. The Group views strong training and career \ndevelopment programs as business opportunities that prepare a \ndiverse and skilled talent pool, ready to meet future challenges. Negative and positive impacts\nNegative impacts\nPoor working conditions (e.g., excessive working hours, poor \nwork-life balance) are among the key issues that have been \nidentified as potential negative impacts by the Group. These issues \nmay lead to psycho-social risks, increased absenteeism, and \ninjured workers. The Group also recognizes the importance of health and safety in \nthe workplace and has identified the Top 5 Hazards that pose \npotential risks to the psychological or physical integrity of its \nemployees: falls, powered industrial trucks (PIT), machinery, road, \nand electrical hazards.

In the social dimension, through the Vigilance plan matrix the \nGroup’s own workforce and value chain are shown to be exposed \nto risks associated mainly with working conditions, while the \nabsence of dialogue can exacerbate issues, leading to strikes, \nproductivity loss, and reputational damage. Significant risks and \nopportunities were identified in line with the Group’s necessity to \nattract, develop, and retain talent with critical skills, which is a \ncornerstone of Schneider Electric’s strategy and business model. As the Group navigates global expansion and digital \ntransformation, it is dependent on establishing ideal working \nconditions to secure top talent in technology, software, services, \nsustainability, supply chain, and electronics. Similarly, diversity, \nequity, and inclusion are prioritized as the Group aims to provide \nequal opportunities across its workforce, committed to fostering \nan\xa0environment where equal treatment is not just a policy, but a \npractice. This commitment also extends to address working \nconditions, which can result in significant reputational and legal \nimpacts, as well as affect the Group’s ability to maintain a top-\nquality workforce if not properly managed. Furthermore, the Group has conscientiously carried out a risk \nassessment to evaluate the impacts and risks arising from its \nimpacts and dependencies on communities. This evaluation was \nconducted for the top 30 Schneider Electric sites worldwide and \na\xa0selection of 40 customer projects. The Group has identified that \ncertain risks are more likely to relate to specific groups of affected \ncommunities rather than to all communities uniformly, such as \ncommunities near industrial sites or near administrative sites, and \ncommunities living in areas impacted by the development of large \nand very large projects. In relation to the end-users of Schneider Electric’s solutions, the \nVigilance plan matrix points to the significance of consumers’ \nsafety and data privacy given the Group’s offer of industrial and \ndigital solutions. If not properly managed, the use of Schneider \nElectric’s solutions could result in physical harm, property damage, \nor leaks of sensitive information. Through the Group’s Vigilance plan matrix, ERM framework, and \nadditional workshops with subject matter experts, various impacts, \nrisk and opportunities were identified and evaluated as material in \nrelation to the governance topic. The potential impact on Schneider \nElectric’s suppliers, as well as the financial risks of corruption and \nbribery cases were underlined as critical.

The analysis of key opportunities takes place notably during the \ncreation of a new SSI.

Context\nGlobal supply chains drive the economic engine of the world. However, the workers powering this engine often do not receive the \nfair share of their contribution, especially when it comes to rights \nand benefits in the areas of working conditions, wages, job, or \nsocial security. The variation among geographies, in socio-economic context, cost \nof non-compliance, and governance, affects the conditions \nextended to the workers. The detrimental impact of these \nmalpractices is not only limited to the individual worker but has a \nsignificant multiplier effect on the physical and psychological \nwell-being of their families, creating a systemic risk in the society at \nlarge. With this realization, the demand for corporate accountability and \nrespect for human rights has grown steadily over the past decade. The publication of the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) \non business and human rights in 2011 marked a turning point and \nclearly put forth the role of states and corporations in respecting \nhuman rights in their value chain and facilitating access to remedy. However, according to the ILO, over 28 million people were still in \nforced labor in 2021, an increase of about 3 million since 2016.

In the social dimension, through the Vigilance plan matrix the \nGroup’s own workforce and value chain are shown to be exposed \nto risks associated mainly with working conditions, while the \nabsence of dialogue can exacerbate issues, leading to strikes, \nproductivity loss, and reputational damage. Significant risks and \nopportunities were identified in line with the Group’s necessity to \nattract, develop, and retain talent with critical skills, which is a \ncornerstone of Schneider Electric’s strategy and business model. As the Group navigates global expansion and digital \ntransformation, it is dependent on establishing ideal working \nconditions to secure top talent in technology, software, services, \nsustainability, supply chain, and electronics.

It shows the following impacts:\n• Forced labor and other labor rights abuses in the value chain, in \nparticular for migrant workers. • Non-decent working conditions in the value chain, in particular \nconcerning health and safety, excessive working time, or wages \nbelow local living wage levels. • Mental health risks, which are increasing as anxiety levels rise \nabout the future of work and life amid disruptions globally. • Safety of customers and end-users due to quality offer risk. • Discrimination and harassment in the workplace, augmented by \nthe risk of population displacement due to climate impact is a \ngrowing risk. • Continued employability may be jeopardized as the disruption \nof office and factory work by new digital technologies could lead \nto poor working conditions in the value chain, ultimately \naffecting the mental and physical health of workers. Context\nGlobal supply chains drive the economic engine of the world. However, the workers powering this engine often do not receive the \nfair share of their contribution, especially when it comes to rights \nand benefits in the areas of working conditions, wages, job, or \nsocial security. The variation among geographies, in socio-economic context, cost \nof non-compliance, and governance, affects the conditions \nextended to the workers. The detrimental impact of these \nmalpractices is not only limited to the individual worker but has a \nsignificant multiplier effect on the physical and psychological \nwell-being of their families, creating a systemic risk in the society at \nlarge. With this realization, the demand for corporate accountability and \nrespect for human rights has grown steadily over the past decade. The publication of the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) \non business and human rights in 2011 marked a turning point and \nclearly put forth the role of states and corporations in respecting \nhuman rights in their value chain and facilitating access to remedy. However, according to the ILO, over 28 million people were still in \nforced labor in 2021, an increase of about 3 million since 2016. In \naddition, the increasing number of armed conflicts, the impacts of \nclimate change, and ongoing technological disruptions increasingly \nput people employed in global value chains at risk.'), Document(id='d836b4d5-0690-4a95-b9da-4bcdbfd90064', metadata={'source': '277', 'page': '125'}, page_content='123\nse.com\nLife Is On | Schneider Electric\nI R\nC H 1\nC H 2  –  S U S T A I N A B L E \nD E V E L O P M E N T\nC H 3\nC H 4\nC H 5\nC H 6\nC H 7\nC H 8\nC H 9\nS U S T A I N A B I L I T Y  S T A T E M E N T S\nE S R S  2\n1  Accelerate climate change through greenhouse \ngas\xa0emissions\n2  Threaten human health and/or the environment by \nusing hazardous substances \n3  Contribute to scarcity of resources through use \nof\xa0critical materials\n4  Generate a significant outflow of materials\n5  Affect the mental and physical health of employees \nrelated to working conditions\n6  Damage the physical integrity of\xa0employees through \nhealth and safety issues\n7  Affect the mental and physical health of value chain \nworkers related to working conditions\n8  Risk detriment to physical health of value chain workers \n(injuries, diseases, or death) from long working hours\n9  Risk poor working conditions in the value chain due to \nlack of dialogue\n10  Damage the physical integrity of workers in the value \nchain through health and safety issues\n11  Jeopardize fundamental human rights and damage the \nphysical or psychological integrity of workers in the \nvalue chain through forced labor\n12  Violate rights of local communities\n13  Trigger physical harm or property damage through \nthe\xa0misuse of the Group’s products\n14  Risk private and sensitive information leaks\n15  Compromise suppliers’ financial stability\n16  Risk health and safety impacts\xa0on\xa0people through \nindustrial accidents related to cybersecurity\n17  Damage the natural environment through industrial \naccidents related to cybersecurity\n18  Risk theft of intellectual property and/or customers’ \nsensitive data\nLegend\n1  Business disruption and asset damage in own \noperations and over the value chain from extreme \nweather events\n2  Failure to adapt to climate-transition market and \ntechnology changes\n3  Debarment from public tenders or public funds\n4  Potential legal proceedings, prosecutions, sanctions,  \nand fines related to non-compliance\n5  Reputational damage related to corruption and bribery\nRisks\n1  Help customers adapt to climate change\n2  Develop new solutions to help customers and value \nchain use their energy and resources more efficiently\n3  Develop new businesses related to renewable energy \nand energy efficiency\n4  Strengthen legal compliance and public reputation\n5  Reinforce stakeholder engagement and loyalty through \nprevention of corruption and bribery\nOpportunities\nNegative impact\n1  Contribute to climate change mitigation through \nsolutions related to energy\xa0efficiency, electrification, \nand renewable energy production\n2  Generate energy savings\n3  Decarbonize market and value chain\n4  Incentivize suppliers to provide green materials\n5  Improve employees’ well-being and feeling of \nbelonging through equal treatment and opportunities\n6  Improvement employability through training and \nskills\xa0development\nPositive impact\n'), Document(id='d8518549-ebc9-4944-b82f-6fd6fed12b07', metadata={'source': '530', 'page': '221'}, page_content='219\nse.com\nLife Is On | Schneider Electric\nI R\nC H 1\nC H 2  –  S U S T A I N A B L E \nD E V E L O P M E N T\nC H 3\nC H 4\nC H 5\nC H 6\nC H 7\nC H 8\nC H 9\nS U S T A I N A B I L I T Y  S T A T E M E N T S\nE S R S  S 1\nInclusion & Care is a marker of Schneider Electric and can continue \nto be a unique competitive advantage if tackled properly and \ngenuinely.

The risk level \nis an average assessment. The geographical location is \nfactored in when selecting suppliers for the audit plan. • Contractors: when implementing a customer project, such as \nbuilding a large electrical system at a customer’s site, Schneider \nElectric works with contractors, leveraging their expertise (civil \nwork, electrical contracting, etc.). This “off-site” project work \nbears specific risks for contractors. A separate “off-site and \nprojects execution” category for contractors has therefore been \ndefined for the assessment. • Local communities: Schneider Electric has identified two distinct \nsegments: communities located around Schneider Electric sites \nand communities located around customer project sites. Communities have been assessed against three risk categories: \nhuman rights, environment, and business ethics. Risk evaluation and scale\nThe evaluation combines the probability of occurrence of the risk, \nwith the seriousness of potential impacts. The risk level displayed in \nthe matrix is an evaluation before impact of mitigation actions \n(“gross risk”). After taking into consideration the impact of these \nmitigation actions, the level of risk may be significantly reduced. However, this “net risk” is not reported in the matrix. Risks are \nassessed on the following scale:\n0 – Non-existent; 1 – Low; 2 – Medium; 3 – High; 4 – Very high. In this 2024 risk assessment, no “very high” risks were \nidentified. Key findings\nThe risk matrix built by Schneider Electric gives an overall and \nsynthetic view of the risks that are present on the vigilance radar \nscreen. From a global and high-level perspective, the following \nrisks are the highest:\nHuman rights\nForced labor, migrant workers\nAccording to the 2021 Global Estimates of Modern Slavery, \napproximately 28 million people are estimated to be in forced labor, \na number alarmingly increasing since 2016. 63% of all forced labor \n(17 million people) is estimated to be imposed by private actors. The report estimates that services (excluding domestic work), and \nmanufacturing are the sectors most exposed, accounting for \nrespectively 32% and 19% of total forced labor. The report also \nidentifies that for manufacturing, most forced labor cases occur in \nproduction in the lower tiers of domestic or global supply chains. This analysis shows that there could be risks of forced labor in the \nlower tiers of Schneider Electric’s supply chain, especially for \nmigrant workers. Although cases have not been identified during \ninternal or supplier audits, Schneider Electric is committed to \nfurther investigate and better mitigate this risk. Working hours, mental health\nThe second category of risk in this section is linked to long working \nhours, work pressure and the consequent psycho-social and \nmental health risks.

Workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion – especially \ngender, generation, and nationality/ethnicity – also need to be a \npriority to ensure equal opportunities for everyone, everywhere. Competition for attracting and recruiting talent in a tight labor \nmarket is intense, and the challenge is amplified for critical digital \nand technical skill sets in key markets. Accelerating skill \ndevelopment (upskilling and reskilling) of employees and the \ndevelopment of leaders who can lead transformation and build \nhuman connections in a digital world is also necessary to reduce \nthe risk of skill gaps and bring greater organizational agility.

As a precautionary approach, Schneider Electric is \naccelerating its policy of reusing, recycling, and expanding product \nlife span to limit the consumption of raw materials, and thereby \npotential associated risks. The Company is also progressing well \non its Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) #4 objective to use \n50%\xa0green materials in its products by 2025, which focuses on \nsteel, aluminum and plastics. Ethical business conduct\nRisks linked to Ethical Business Conduct are the subject of \nparticular attention by the Group. Schneider Electric is exposed \nto\xa0this type of risk due to several factors. First, its geographical \npresence in countries exposed to corruption. This is especially \ntrue\xa0when managing large and complex projects including \nsubcontractors. Specific caution and stringent rules are applied, \nparticularly when dealing with public authority or agents. Second, \ngeopolitical tensions have significantly increased the number of \nsanctions and export control rules. Several actions were \nimplemented to raise awareness and tighten control, both internally \nand with external commercial partners. Finally, Schneider Electric \nis aware that tensions on suppliers of certain raw materials may \nincrease risks of unethical business conduct in the procurement \nchain. This risk is more difficult to mitigate, especially as the \nprocurement of such materials is often not done by Schneider \nElectric but by suppliers. However, Schneider Electric is taking this \nsubject seriously and is striving to develop better understanding \nand control across its supply chain. Local communities\nOne last category of risks to mention is the local communities. Although Schneider Electric is not often operating in an \nenvironment where its presence is having a significant impact on \ncommunities (both through its direct operations or that of its \nsuppliers), it may happen that customer projects may be located in \nsensitive environments. Therefore, Schneider has started a review \nof its main projects to better identify the type of risk that may arise, \nand the possible mitigations. As mentioned in the “pollution from \nraw materials” section, the extraction and processing phases of the \nmetals used by Schneider Electric may have negative impacts on \nlocal communities. Offer safety and cybersecurity\nSchneider Electric’s offers of products, solutions, services, and \nsoftware allow customers to pilot their operations with efficiency \nand productivity, and to optimize their energy consumption, hence \ntheir carbon footprint. These offers are highly digital, and often \nrelated to the core of the customer’s process, for example a factory, \na chemical plant, a power generation plant, or an office building. Therefore, any breach or event with cybersecurity may have \nimportant consequences for customers, from a material or safety \nand security perspective. For this reason, cybersecurity is on the \ntop of Schneider’s agenda, not only from a vigilance point of view, \nbut also from a strategic point of view. As this topic is highly \ntechnical, we invite the reader to refer to the Universal Registration \nDocument (URD) dedicated section, as well as the specialized \nreports available on Schneider Electric’s website. Comparison of the 2024 analysis with 2023\nIn 2024, to converge towards the requirements of the CSRD, the \nrisk analysis performed has further detailed two dimensions: \nseverity and likelihood. The calculation of the matrix has therefore \nbeen improved, leading to slight modifications in the ratings of \ncertain scores, although these risks have not fundamentally \nchanged compared to last year. Yet, following items have evolved:\n• In the Decent Workplace section, the level of Human Rights \nrisks for Migrant Workers was revaluated in 2023, as a \nconsequence of the increased migration flows. The origins \nof\xa0these displacements are multiple, from climate change to \nconflicts or economic hardship.'), Document(id='748d9db3-4b56-45d6-be91-ef5ab65f24ec', metadata={'source': '600', 'page': '246'}, page_content='8. Social protection\nIndustrial wages are often not sufficient to provide adequate living standards. The problem is exacerbated \nin cases of health emergencies. Social protection, provided by employers/governments, provide a much-\nneeded safety net from economic shock, descent into poverty, and vulnerability. Companies should ensure \nthat all employees have access to the social security safety net. 9. Purchasing \npractices\nPurchasing practices and requirements significantly impact working conditions. They influence the working \nculture of the supplier organization to meet customer requirements. The power of procurement can be a \nstrong driver for positive change to include decent work conditions as a pre-requisite among the supply \nchain partners, when balanced with other commercial criteria. 10. Balancing work \nand family life\nFamily responsibilities disproportionately impact genders and result in unequal participation in economic \nactivities. Workplaces should strive to create a level playing field and provide all possible opportunities to \nemployees to participate in economic activities without compromising the family responsibilities, which may \nrequire periods away from work (e.g., maternity, family care, flexible hours, and adequate childcare). Work \nenvironment should act as a leveler/equalizer and not augment the disparity.

Schneider Electric firmly \nbelieves that well-being generates performance and performance \ngenerates well-being. Well-being can be a unique competitive advantage if tackled \nproperly and genuinely. Schneider has identified three main risks \naround those topics:\n• Poor working conditions may result in psycho-social risks. • Market research shows that well-being at work is on a persistent \ndecline, hitting minority groups harder. • Employee engagement, performance, and retention are at risk \nwhen employee well-being is deteriorating. On the flip side, the opportunities are huge when inclusion and \ncare are by design in all processes and behaviors:\n• Figures on stress and psychological risks, from Ecole du Stress \nshows that for every 1 euro invested in well-being prevention \nprograms and practices, a company saves 2.2 euros. • A study from Forbes (“The Future of Work Depends on \nSupporting Gen Z”) shows that overall, DEI and well-being are \nstrong drivers of attraction and retention among all generations, \nespecially the younger ones. Schneider Electric defines its strategy taking into consideration \nthose risks and opportunities, internal and external trends, insights \nand feedback from leaders and employees, and its desire to \ncontinue nurturing an inclusive and caring environment. Since \n2020, the Trust Charter included a chapter on well-being and new \nways of\xa0working, highlighting behaviors expected from managers \nand employees. Working organisation\nPolicy\nGlobal Family Leave Policy\nAs a caring, inclusive, and responsible employer, Schneider \nlaunched its Global Family Leave policy along with care leave in \n2017. Through its policy, the Group supports employees with \npersonal time at critical life stages and empowers everyone to \nmanage their “unique life and work” to enable them to be at their \nbest. While countries have flexibility to define eligibility and policy \ndetails per statutory and/or market requirements, the policy \nestablishes a global minimum standard for paid leave. In 2023, the Group globally deployed the updated Global Family \nLeave Policy for all employees, where parental and care leave were \nincreased. Although the duration for bereavement leaves remained \nunchanged, the local adaptation was enhanced by adopting a \nflexible definition of “Immediate Family” in acknowledgment of the \ndiverse cultures and religions displayed by the global workforce. Schneider Electric’s Global Family Leave Policy was recognized by \nthe Brandon Hall Group in September 2023, receiving a Gold \nAward for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion – affirming the Group’s \nposition as a caring, inclusive, and responsible employer. Additional to the Group’s Global Family Leave Policy and, in \nsupport of global standards and local empowerment, back-up \nfamily care benefits are offered in some countries to assist \nemployees with family care needs when they experience disruption \nin regular care arrangements. In the absence of a Group-level \nback-up family care policy, the Group highlights examples of \nback-up family care benefits that are offered at the country level. Globally, the Group also offers an Employee Assistance Program \nwith coverage in over 90% of its operating countries which \nprovides\xa0additional support and resources for mental well-being \nand family care. Beyond the Global Family Leave Policy and Employee Assistance \nProgram, some countries where Schneider Electric operates \nprovide support in the form of on-site childcare facilities, childcare \ncontributions, and breast-feeding and lactation benefits. The policy is accessible to employees via the intranet and has been \napproved by the Chief Human Resource Officer, reviewed by the \nSenior Vice-President Total Rewards & Performance, with policy \nownership by the Vice-President, Total Rewards & Performance \nInnovation & Strategy.'), Document(id='15ae7c21-9164-4c09-85e4-bef27a90f48e', metadata={'source': '609', 'page': '250'}, page_content='Read more in section 2.2.3.2 on page 236. 2.2.3.3.5 People living around mines in \nSchneider Electric’s upstream supply \nchain, including indigenous people\nRisks related to raw material extraction and transformation in \nSchneider Electric upstream supply chain are difficult to evaluate \nprecisely because they are located far upstream, which makes \ndata difficult to obtain. For this reason, the evaluation of risks is \nmostly based on external reports. According to the Transition Minerals Tracker 2024 Analysis, key \nimpacts on communities around mines include:\n• Attacks against human rights defenders, \n• Land rights, \n• Personal health, \n• Impacts on livelihoods, \n• Impacts on indigenous rights, \n• Clean, healthy, and sustainable environment, \n• Access to water and \n• Water pollution\nSchneider Electric’s approach is to evaluate those risks and \nimplement prevention or mitigation plans for each material, \nprioritizing them by procurement volume and human rights risks. The Group is engaged in various programs relating to raw \nmaterials:\n• Conflict minerals program (Tin, Tungsten, Tantalum, Gold + \nCobalt and Mica)\n• SSI #4 program (Aluminum, Steel, Plastics) with the ambition to \nincrease green material content in our products to 50%. Read more on the methodology of SSI in section 2.4.1.1 \non pages 311 to 316. For raw materials that are necessary for Schneider Electric’s \nactivities and are not yet covered by one of the programs \nmentioned before (such as copper), a specific study has been \nstarted to better understand the impact of these industries. This \nstudy will also allow Schneider Electric to investigate the existing \ncertifications and coalitions for these raw materials. The impacts of \nthe mining industry being far upstream and the leverages to act \nbeing thus limited, the Group’s strategy is to work with other actors \nto improve the social and environmental conditions of mineral \nextraction through certifications and coalitions. In addition to aiming for more certification of its raw material \nprocurement, Schneider Electric is accelerating its circularity \nstrategy to limit the consumption of raw materials, and thereby \npotential associated risks.

Nonetheless, as its \nmanufacturing and service activities may be associated with \nother\xa0material impacts, risks, and opportunities, the Group has \nimplemented a Vigilance plan for suppliers, which requires \nan\xa0annual risk evaluation of the entire supply base. This \ncomprehensive evaluation encompasses sustainability risks and \nspecific parameters such as suppliers’ industrial processes, \ntechnology, and geographic location. A third-party independent \ndatabase that employs the RBA methodology has also been \nutilized since January 2018 to complement the analysis. No direct \nconsultation was conducted with communities on pollution issues, \nhowever, stakeholder representative consultations performed in \n2024 validated the results of the assessment as non-material. Schneider Electric additionally screens its assets and activities \nfor\xa0water and marine resources–related impacts, risks, and \nopportunities using a structured process. This includes ISO \n14001-certified environmental risk analysis at main sites, the World \nResource Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas Tool for \nidentifying water-stressed sites, and the Property Damage and \nBusiness Interruption process for extreme weather risks.

The Sustainability Matters on the conditions of workers in the value \nchain and on forced labor in the value chain are material issues \nidentified in the Schneider Electric materiality analysis. The \nCompany has deployed a robust governance and supplier \nengagement framework to perform a risk analysis to screen and \nmitigate the risk of workers in upstream. The Company’s supply \nchain is exposed to varying levels of risks depending on the \nenvironmental, social, and ethical contexts of the countries in which \nthey operate. These country-related risks are one of the important \nfactors in customizing risk profile of suppliers. To evaluate and mitigate the sustainability risk from its global \nsuppliers, Schneider Electric conducts a risk evaluation of its entire \nsupply base on an annual basis. This evaluation covers \nsustainability risks and specific parameters such as the type of \nindustrial process used by the suppliers, their technology, and the \ngeographic location. This allows the Group to factor in risks that \nmay arise from a country’s specific situation (social, political, etc.). These parameters are compiled in a third-party independent \ndatabase (RBA methodology, ex-EICC, of which Schneider Electric \nhas been a member since January 2018). Schneider Electric’s \nentire Core network of about 50,000 tier 1 suppliers is processed \nthrough this methodology and is refreshed every year with the new \nsupplier baseline to identify high risk suppliers. The non-high-risk suppliers are deemed appropriate for remote/ \nself-assessment, via an ESG questionnaire. The supplier responses \nto the questionnaire are evaluated by a team of specialists. Upon \nidentifying any response, which requires further deep dive, the \nteam engages with the suppliers for clarifications. Post the \nclarification, if the need is felt, on-site audits may be triggered. For \nthe suppliers who are classified as high risk, on-site audit by \nSchneider Electric auditors is conducted. The Duty of Vigilance (SSE #17) program has a mandate of on-site \naudit of 1,000 high risk suppliers between 2021 and 2025; 3,000 \nmedium-risk suppliers are evaluated based on desktop review and \nfollowed up by on-site audit, in case of any high concerns. The \nannual target is 200 on-site audits and 600 remote evaluations per \nyear for non-high-risk suppliers between 2021 and 2025. This SSE \n#17 has been achieved with 4,050+ suppliers at the end of 2024, \ntherefore one year in advance. In 2024, 240 on-site audits were \nperformed, and 564 suppliers answered to the self-assessment \nquestionnaire. Read more on the methodology of SSE in \nsection\xa02.4.1.2 on pages 316 to 321. To implement the key tenets with the suppliers in scope, Schneider \nElectric follows the RBA ESG criteria, which includes worker rights, \nenvironment management, occupational health and safety, and its \ninclusion in the governance of the Company. This common set of \nrequirements is used to evaluate supplier performance via on-site \naudits. The high-risk suppliers of Schneider Electric are subjected \nto on-site audit, conducted by specialized auditors. The audits \nspan over 2-3 days and include facility walkthrough, review of \nmanagement policies, worker interviews and examination of \noperational records to validate the conformances.')]","[Document(id='e5d51521-69d7-4e51-b2d9-f43ab67755a4', metadata={'source': '579', 'page': '239'}, page_content='Due to the diverse context, the workforce \ninvolved is a mix providing generic services such as \nhousekeeping to highly specialized services such as advisory, \nand segments across manufacturing or commercial activities. 2.2.3.2.2 Policy framework guiding \nsustainability in the value chain\nHuman Rights Policy\nSchneider Electric Trust Charter is the Group’s Code of Conduct. Through the Trust Charter, Schneider Electric is taking a strong \nposition on what values it stands for with a focus on several human \nrights topics that serves as a basis for the relative policy. Schneider Electric’s Global Human Rights Policy was last updated \nin 2022 and approved by the Group’s Chairman. It is articulated \naround three principles. 1. Schneider Electric is committed to fully respecting and applying \nlaws and regulations in all countries where it operates. 2. Schneider Electric is committed to fostering and promoting \nhuman rights throughout all its operational sites and subsidiaries \nworldwide. 3. Schneider wishes to support human rights beyond its borders, \nleveraging its large network of partners and stakeholders to \npromote the implementation of actions that will ensure the \nrespect of people’s rights. The Human Rights Policy’s objective is to define the Group’s \nposition on human rights along its value chain, including forced \nlabor, health and safety, or working conditions. The Group both \nstates in the document that “to the best of its knowledge, it refrains \nfrom working with business partners that are using forced or \ncompulsory labor in their operations” and that it “is committed to \nensuring that human rights are respected not only in its own \noperations but throughout its value chain. The Group considers that \na company should seek to provide decent work not only to its own \nemployees but the same should be extended to its value chain”. It also states Schneider Electric’s commitment to provide or support \nremedy in case the Group has caused or contributed to a negative \nimpact. The Human Rights Policy serves as a set of rules \napplicable to its daily operations for Schneider Electric and \nits\xa0employees. The policy is available in eight languages and applies to all \nSchneider Electric affiliates. It is applicable to all Schneider Electric \npermanent or temporary employees working on Group premises. It\xa0also aims to inspire external stakeholders. The policy provides a \nframework and gives guidance to employees and teams on how to \nbehave in their daily operations or when facing a specific situation.

Decent working hours;\n4. Stability and security of work;\n5. Social dialogue and workplace relations;\n6. Fair treatment in employment; \n7. Safe work; \n8. Social protection;\n9. Purchasing practices; and\n10. Balancing work and family life. The program requires strategic suppliers to develop a proactive \npolicy as a means to extend safe, attractive and inclusive \nworkplace to their employees. Criteria defined for each Decent \nWork pillar may also overlap with ISO\xa026000 standard and are \nvalidated by the Global Procurement, Human Resources, Supply \nChain, and Sustainability teams. The suppliers will be assessed through remote questionnaires \nsupported by relevant documentation, as well as on-site visits and \nspot audits, and their performance will be monitored by experts. All \nquestions have a minimum acceptable answer defined. Suppliers \nresponses will be evaluated against the minimum acceptable \ncriteria to qualify as Decent Work compliant. Program deployment \nis ensured by specialists of Sustainable Procurement from Global \nProcurement function, who are responsible to onboard, train, and \nassess suppliers. The program implementation is supported by the \nGlobal Procurement Services. Through DWP, Schneider aims to enhance social integration, \nequity, security, dignity, satisfaction, and overall improvement in the \nquality of life for the workers, and their family. For a supplier to fully \nadhere to the DWP, the Global Procurement team will look at \ninclusion of the requirements in the supplier’s organizational \nframework by means of policies, processes etc. Incase of missing \nor non alignment, the suppliers need to initiate corrective measures \nwhich aim to institutionalise the requirements within the company. The evaluation of this is undertaken and supported by review of \nrelevant documentations. If the requirements are effectively \nincorporated in the policies and processes, the supplier can be \ncounted as conforming to DWP in the KPI calculation. Otherwise, \nit\xa0is still counted as non-compliant regarding the requirements of \nthe program. A pilot for this indicator was launched in 2022, and its was \nintegrated to the SSI score computation in the same year. PwC provided limited assurance on this indicator. SSI #7: Measure the level of confidence of our \nemployees to report behaviors against our \nprinciples of Trust \nOur “Speak Up” mindset helps to maintain high standards, a strong \nreputation, and a healthy and productive working environment, and \nprotects Schneider Electric and its employees from multiple risks. Misconduct situations will be less likely to occur if people, \nemployees, and stakeholders feel safe to speak up about \nconcerns, dilemmas, or issues in good faith, respectfully, and \nwithout fear of retaliation. Our Trust Charter and Ethics & Compliance program participate to \ntransform this belief into practical actions, notably offering multiple \nfair, neutral, and confidential reporting channels to our employees \nto make them feel confident to report unethical conduct. In order to assess this KPI, the question “I can report an instance of \nunethical conduct without fear” is annually asked to all Schneider \nElectric employees in the OneVoice survey. The percentage of \n“Agree” and “Strongly Agree” amongst the answers determines\nthe level of confidence of Schneider Employees to report unethical \nconduct.

Various inputs are factored in these annual assessments:\n• Interviews with internal experts and leaders;\n• Reports from audits conducted at risky suppliers; \n• Alerts raised through our Trust Line alert mechanism;\n• Internal audits on the Human Rights Policy;\n• Reviews of available business and human rights literature (such \nas reports from the International Labor Organization (ILO), or \nfrom the Business and Human Rights Resource Center); and\n• Engagement with peers, multi-stakeholder initiatives, institutions \nor NGOs (such as the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), the \nCopper Mark, or Human Resources Without Borders). The analysis of key opportunities takes place notably during the \ncreation of a new SSI. It shows the following impacts:\n• Forced labor and other labor rights abuses in the value chain, in \nparticular for migrant workers. • Non-decent working conditions in the value chain, in particular \nconcerning health and safety, excessive working time, or wages \nbelow local living wage levels. • Mental health risks, which are increasing as anxiety levels rise \nabout the future of work and life amid disruptions globally. • Safety of customers and end-users due to quality offer risk. • Discrimination and harassment in the workplace, augmented by \nthe risk of population displacement due to climate impact is a \ngrowing risk. • Continued employability may be jeopardized as the disruption \nof office and factory work by new digital technologies could lead \nto poor working conditions in the value chain, ultimately \naffecting the mental and physical health of workers. Context\nGlobal supply chains drive the economic engine of the world. However, the workers powering this engine often do not receive the \nfair share of their contribution, especially when it comes to rights \nand benefits in the areas of working conditions, wages, job, or \nsocial security. The variation among geographies, in socio-economic context, cost \nof non-compliance, and governance, affects the conditions \nextended to the workers. The detrimental impact of these \nmalpractices is not only limited to the individual worker but has a \nsignificant multiplier effect on the physical and psychological \nwell-being of their families, creating a systemic risk in the society at \nlarge. With this realization, the demand for corporate accountability and \nrespect for human rights has grown steadily over the past decade. The publication of the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) \non business and human rights in 2011 marked a turning point and \nclearly put forth the role of states and corporations in respecting \nhuman rights in their value chain and facilitating access to remedy. However, according to the ILO, over 28 million people were still in \nforced labor in 2021, an increase of about 3 million since 2016.

However, in all EEA countries where we \noperate, each country with more than 150 employees has at least \none seat at the European Works Council (EWC) to represent and \nvoice Employees’ views (as per 2014 EWC agreement). In addition, \nas per same EWC agreement, UK and Switzerland have Employee \nRepresentatives at European Works Council. At Global level, as per Global Human Rights Policy, SE protects \nfreedom of association and values social dialogue with employee \nrepresentatives, in respect of local rules. Global standards are \nbeing defined to go further in all the countries where we operate. Today, at global level, 78% of employees are covered by collective \nbargaining agreements and 60% of our employees are represented \nby unions to improve further the two-way dialogue with our \nemployees. This comes in addition to our listening culture (One \nVoice annual employee survey), our internal whistleblowing \nplatform on potential unethical issue (Trust Line) and existing \nDecent work program for our employees. Adequate wage\nPolicy\nSchneider Electric firmly believes that earning a living wage is a \nfundamental human right and an essential element of decent work. This commitment is included in our Human Rights Policy and Trust \nCharter, guiding our efforts to ensure that all employees receive at \nor above a living wage to meet their families’ basic needs which \ninclude food, housing, sanitation, education, healthcare, clothing, \ntransportation, and communication plus discretionary income for a \ngiven local standard of living. Schneider Electric conducts annual living wage gap analysis since \n2018. Starting in 2021, the Group committed to paying 100% of \nemployees at least a living wage as part of Schneider Sustainability \nEssentials (SSE #20). The company works with the expert \nconsultant Fair Wage Network to ensure compliance. An external \ncompany provides limited assurance to ensure year-over-year \ncompliance with this commitment. The SSE #20 reporting protocol \nis accessible to employees via the intranet and has been approved \nby the Senior-Vice President, Total Rewards and Performance. Action plan\nCollaborating with Fair Wage Network since 2022 allowed the \nGroup to improve geographical coverage, develop a dynamic \nweb-based living wage benchmark, and initiate an independent \nreview and certification of the living wage gap analysis. Schneider \nElectric was certified in March 2024, by the Fair Wage Network, \nbeing qualified as a “Living Wage Employer” for a second \nconsecutive time, valid until December 31, 2025. As a part of 2024 ambition to comply with CSRD requirements on \nadequate wage, Schneider Electric has reviewed its methodology \nand focused its analysis on fixed compensation only.

In 2024, \n51% of the closed, valid, and substantiated alerts reported \nthrough\xa0whistleblowing, concerned discrimination, harassment, \nand sexual harassment. Read more on the Whistleblowing policy in \nsection\xa02.2.1.1.3 on pages 102 to 107. To build a common understanding and alignment, Schneider \nElectric also created a mandatory training entitled “Building an \nInclusive and Caring Mindset” and assigned it to all employees as \npart of Schneider Essentials (mandatory for all) in 2024. 99.4% of \nemployees completed the training. In addition, in 2024, the Group \nhas deployed a “Prevent and manage harassment and \ndiscrimination” for Human Resources Business Partners and \nmanagers, and some specific trainings were deployed in line with \nlocal initiatives to prevent sexual harassment in specific countries \n(e.g. India, Germany, Austria, Switzerland). To enhance workplace-related alert handling, the Group introduced \nupdated e-learning in 2024 for its HR internal investigators, \nensuring impartiality and consistent practices. The number of HR \ninvestigators was increased in 2024 to bolster investigation \ncapabilities across all regions. Workshops have been also \nconducted for internal investigators in many geographies, and a \npilot mediation program was launched in France. In addition, HR \nprocesses were strengthened through background check updates \nto the Personnel Management Security Policy, enhanced Hiring \nGuidelines with a focus on compliance (including re-hire \nprocesses), and the creation of a new Ethics & Compliance \nquestionnaire for the Interview Guide Tool. In 2024, a dedicated communication plan was carried out, \npromoting the Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Policy and \nraising awareness.

The \nprogram is dedicated to human rights and takes inspiration from \nthe work of the ILO and includes key tenets into the program \ncontent. The program also combines key requirements and focal areas of \nseveral other international frameworks and bodies such as United \nNations Global Compact, European Commission, United Nations \nSustainable Development Goals and even aligning with the key \nrequirements of SA8000 management standard. The scope of the program includes strategic suppliers across \ndirect (also known as production) and indirect (known as non-\nproduction) procurement. The initiative adopts the approach of a \ndevelopment program, acknowledging that the program criteria \nmay be new for many suppliers who will need support with capacity \nbuilding, and constant engagement throughout implementation. The evaluation of supplier performance is carried out through an \nonline questionnaire that is rolled out via SSP-SRM – Schneider \nElectric’s supplier relationship portal. A specifically trained team of \nassociates from Global Procurement Services (GPS) lead the\nlaunch of the initiative. The suppliers are required to respond to the \nquestions and upload evidence to support the responses. All \nresponses and accompanying evidence are evaluated to meet the \nminimum criteria of decent work. These responses and documents \nare assessed by specially trained reviewers. The reviewers come \nfrom within Schneider Electric as well as third-party agencies who \nspecialize in business and human rights. In cases where the \nsupplier actions do not meet the minimum requirements, feedback \nis given, and corrective actions need to be implemented by the \nsuppliers in a timely manner. Upon rectification, the information \nneeds to be resubmitted along with the evidence for the re-\nevaluation. To better engage suppliers and identify the common \nareas of improvement for deploying more effective supplier \ncapacity building initiatives, the responses were analyzed. Below is \nthe summary of the most frequent gaps identified during the year. There is a high level of engagement with constant training, capacity \nbuilding, and communication with suppliers to ensure they \nunderstand the actions required and implement them.'), Document(id='35cebe8a-4ce4-468c-9d58-241766831dd7', metadata={'source': '246', 'page': '112'}, page_content='The scope of this review \nincludes Schneider Electric’s own sites and the ones belonging \nto its subsidiaries. • Suppliers: the level of risk differs based on the type of process \nand technologies used, and the Group has therefore segmented \nthe analysis by component category of purchase. The risk level \nis an average assessment. The geographical location is \nfactored in when selecting suppliers for the audit plan. • Contractors: when implementing a customer project, such as \nbuilding a large electrical system at a customer’s site, Schneider \nElectric works with contractors, leveraging their expertise (civil \nwork, electrical contracting, etc.). This “off-site” project work \nbears specific risks for contractors. A separate “off-site and \nprojects execution” category for contractors has therefore been \ndefined for the assessment. • Local communities: Schneider Electric has identified two distinct \nsegments: communities located around Schneider Electric sites \nand communities located around customer project sites. Communities have been assessed against three risk categories: \nhuman rights, environment, and business ethics. Risk evaluation and scale\nThe evaluation combines the probability of occurrence of the risk, \nwith the seriousness of potential impacts. The risk level displayed in \nthe matrix is an evaluation before impact of mitigation actions \n(“gross risk”). After taking into consideration the impact of these \nmitigation actions, the level of risk may be significantly reduced. However, this “net risk” is not reported in the matrix. Risks are \nassessed on the following scale:\n0 – Non-existent; 1 – Low; 2 – Medium; 3 – High; 4 – Very high. In this 2024 risk assessment, no “very high” risks were \nidentified. Key findings\nThe risk matrix built by Schneider Electric gives an overall and \nsynthetic view of the risks that are present on the vigilance radar \nscreen. From a global and high-level perspective, the following \nrisks are the highest:\nHuman rights\nForced labor, migrant workers\nAccording to the 2021 Global Estimates of Modern Slavery, \napproximately 28 million people are estimated to be in forced labor, \na number alarmingly increasing since 2016. 63% of all forced labor \n(17 million people) is estimated to be imposed by private actors. The report estimates that services (excluding domestic work), and \nmanufacturing are the sectors most exposed, accounting for \nrespectively 32% and 19% of total forced labor. The report also \nidentifies that for manufacturing, most forced labor cases occur in \nproduction in the lower tiers of domestic or global supply chains. This analysis shows that there could be risks of forced labor in the \nlower tiers of Schneider Electric’s supply chain, especially for \nmigrant workers. Although cases have not been identified during \ninternal or supplier audits, Schneider Electric is committed to \nfurther investigate and better mitigate this risk. Working hours, mental health\nThe second category of risk in this section is linked to long working \nhours, work pressure and the consequent psycho-social and \nmental health risks.

Social Excellence program\nIn addition to the above-mentioned engagement, the Company has \ninitiated development of a Social Excellence program, which aims \nto go beyond tier 1 suppliers and onboard them on the human \nrights journey. Currently the Company is implementing a pilot program to assess \nhow such a program, focused on upstream, can be developed and \ndeployed. While the program is still in exploratory stage, it will \nprovide invaluable insights that will help in conceptualizing a \nfull-fledged program (the actual date for full scale deployment will \ndepend on the findings of ongoing pilot, due for completion by end \nof 2025). Towards this the Company has identified a particular product and \ncreated 3 work streams to evaluate the risk. These include:\n• Traceability workstream: this includes connecting with suppliers \nand seeking details about their sub-suppliers to ensure \ntransparency and accountability. • Geographies workstream: using the RBA risk evaluation tool, \nhigh-risk countries are identified, and suppliers located in those \ncountries are engaged via worker voice tool to identify key \nimpacting areas. • Raw materials workstream: focus on the critical minerals as \nidentified by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and aims to \nengage supplier to increase the accountability in the upstream \nmining and processing stages. During 2024, as part of the Geography workstream, the Company \ninitiated the use of “Worker Voice” surveys, with a pilot in Vietnam, \nand organized feedback sessions with the suppliers involved in \n2024.

Adequate wage\nPolicy\nSchneider Electric firmly believes that earning a living wage is a \nfundamental human right and an essential element of decent work. This commitment is included in our Human Rights Policy and Trust \nCharter, guiding our efforts to ensure that all employees receive at \nor above a living wage to meet their families’ basic needs which \ninclude food, housing, sanitation, education, healthcare, clothing, \ntransportation, and communication plus discretionary income for a \ngiven local standard of living. Schneider Electric conducts annual living wage gap analysis since \n2018. Starting in 2021, the Group committed to paying 100% of \nemployees at least a living wage as part of Schneider Sustainability \nEssentials (SSE #20). The company works with the expert \nconsultant Fair Wage Network to ensure compliance. An external \ncompany provides limited assurance to ensure year-over-year \ncompliance with this commitment. The SSE #20 reporting protocol \nis accessible to employees via the intranet and has been approved \nby the Senior-Vice President, Total Rewards and Performance. Action plan\nCollaborating with Fair Wage Network since 2022 allowed the \nGroup to improve geographical coverage, develop a dynamic \nweb-based living wage benchmark, and initiate an independent \nreview and certification of the living wage gap analysis. Schneider \nElectric was certified in March 2024, by the Fair Wage Network, \nbeing qualified as a “Living Wage Employer” for a second \nconsecutive time, valid until December 31, 2025.

This also includes employee shareholding as \npart of the long-term incentive plan allocations. Responsible workplace\nEmployee engagement process\nEngaged employees are key to enable the Company to be at its \nbest and support the achievement of the Group strategy. Employees are invited to share their honest feedback through an \nannual engagement survey, which measures ten key drivers, \nincluding well-being, inclusion, recognition, and empowerment. Through the information collected, the Company gains greater \nunderstanding of the views of employees, including areas of \nstrength and improvement. Insights are used to inform action plans \nacross the organization. Leaders are guided to co-create the \nactions with their teams, reinforcing the dialogue needed to shape \nthe workplace of tomorrow. This process also contributes to the impacts, risks, and \nopportunities mentioned in the beginning of this chapter. Action plan\nSupported by a global network of engagement partners and HR \nBusiness Partners, each year managers communicate results to \ntheir teams and formulate impactful action plans to drive change. In\xa02024, several initiatives were implemented to further support \nmanagers following survey closure:\n• Manager journey defined through three phases: Assess \n(understand team results), Huddle (share results and collaborate \non focus areas), and Act (finalize and implement action plan). • Refreshed Manager Report and Dashboard Toolkit, empowering \nmanagers to quickly share results with their teams. • Action plan and communication templates for consistency and \nefficiency. • Dedicated manager results dashboard, with guiding content \nand reminders of key next steps.

These include physical motor or \nphysical health, sensory, cognitive, and neuro diversities, and \npsychological, emotional, or behavioral.

In addition, social dialogue at Schneider Electric includes also the \ncontinuous listening culture with the annual survey “OneVoice”, sent \nto all employees, allowing them to share their feedback on a \nvoluntary basis, on key topics related to their workplace and \nexperience appreciation. In its Trust Charter (Schneider Electric’s Code of Conduct), \nSchneider commits to follow all the requirements to build and \nsustain fruitful and mutually beneficial relationships between labor \norganizations and management, in accordance with local \nregulations, in every country where it operates. In its Group \nHuman Rights Policy, Schneider Electric reaffirms those \nprinciples as the basis for a regular dialogue between management \nand employees. To that purpose, Schneider Electric respects the \nindividual right of its employees to freely join, participate in, or quit \nlabor organizations to assert and defend their interests.

In case of any issue, employees are encouraged to report, using \nthe internal reporting tool for unethical behavior or misconduct, \ncalled the “Trust Line”. Schneider Electric also values the importance of dialogue with \nfreely appointed employee representatives, employee \nrepresentative bodies (e.g., works councils or employee forums), or \norganizations (like trade unions), and supports collective \nbargaining. In addition, to provide multi-cultural social dialogue on \ntransnational projects, the highest level of Leadership is engaged; \nas an example, the seat of European Works Council Chairperson is \nheld by an HR Senior Vice-President, demonstrating Schneider’s \ninvolvement in that two-way dialogue. In addition to the above, the Group hardwires its principles in the \nway it manages social dialogue in countries. On transnational \ntopics, engagement with employee representatives from European \ncountries is described in the agreement signed in 2014. It contains \nengagement rules for the information, consultation and \nparticipation of Schneider Electric employees and representatives \nin Europe. This agreement describes the composition of the \nEuropean Works Council, as well as the various roles of its \nmembers (Chairperson, Core Council, Secretary, plenary \nmembers) and the cadence of engagement, i.e. the yearly meeting \nwith the plenary members, in addition to the quarterly meeting with \nthe Core Council, as per circumstances.'), Document(id='45d81c2e-1a60-4b1c-b717-17ac982cdb90', metadata={'source': '537', 'page': '223'}, page_content='It also reinforces employees’ rights and responsibilities, notably \nregarding anti-retaliation.

In addition, in 2024, the Group \nhas deployed a “Prevent and manage harassment and \ndiscrimination” for Human Resources Business Partners and \nmanagers, and some specific trainings were deployed in line with \nlocal initiatives to prevent sexual harassment in specific countries \n(e.g. India, Germany, Austria, Switzerland). To enhance workplace-related alert handling, the Group introduced \nupdated e-learning in 2024 for its HR internal investigators, \nensuring impartiality and consistent practices. The number of HR \ninvestigators was increased in 2024 to bolster investigation \ncapabilities across all regions. Workshops have been also \nconducted for internal investigators in many geographies, and a \npilot mediation program was launched in France. In addition, HR \nprocesses were strengthened through background check updates \nto the Personnel Management Security Policy, enhanced Hiring \nGuidelines with a focus on compliance (including re-hire \nprocesses), and the creation of a new Ethics & Compliance \nquestionnaire for the Interview Guide Tool. In 2024, a dedicated communication plan was carried out, \npromoting the Anti-Harassment & Anti-Discrimination Policy and \nraising awareness.

Various inputs are factored in these annual assessments:\n• Interviews with internal experts and leaders;\n• Reports from audits conducted at risky suppliers; \n• Alerts raised through our Trust Line alert mechanism;\n• Internal audits on the Human Rights Policy;\n• Reviews of available business and human rights literature (such \nas reports from the International Labor Organization (ILO), or \nfrom the Business and Human Rights Resource Center); and\n• Engagement with peers, multi-stakeholder initiatives, institutions \nor NGOs (such as the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), the \nCopper Mark, or Human Resources Without Borders). The analysis of key opportunities takes place notably during the \ncreation of a new SSI. It shows the following impacts:\n• Forced labor and other labor rights abuses in the value chain, in \nparticular for migrant workers. • Non-decent working conditions in the value chain, in particular \nconcerning health and safety, excessive working time, or wages \nbelow local living wage levels. • Mental health risks, which are increasing as anxiety levels rise \nabout the future of work and life amid disruptions globally. • Safety of customers and end-users due to quality offer risk. • Discrimination and harassment in the workplace, augmented by \nthe risk of population displacement due to climate impact is a \ngrowing risk. • Continued employability may be jeopardized as the disruption \nof office and factory work by new digital technologies could lead \nto poor working conditions in the value chain, ultimately \naffecting the mental and physical health of workers. Context\nGlobal supply chains drive the economic engine of the world. However, the workers powering this engine often do not receive the \nfair share of their contribution, especially when it comes to rights \nand benefits in the areas of working conditions, wages, job, or \nsocial security. The variation among geographies, in socio-economic context, cost \nof non-compliance, and governance, affects the conditions \nextended to the workers. The detrimental impact of these \nmalpractices is not only limited to the individual worker but has a \nsignificant multiplier effect on the physical and psychological \nwell-being of their families, creating a systemic risk in the society at \nlarge. With this realization, the demand for corporate accountability and \nrespect for human rights has grown steadily over the past decade. The publication of the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) \non business and human rights in 2011 marked a turning point and \nclearly put forth the role of states and corporations in respecting \nhuman rights in their value chain and facilitating access to remedy. However, according to the ILO, over 28 million people were still in \nforced labor in 2021, an increase of about 3 million since 2016. In \naddition, the increasing number of armed conflicts, the impacts of \nclimate change, and ongoing technological disruptions increasingly \nput people employed in global value chains at risk.'), Document(id='fb628753-a298-4111-a173-0d8313bada06', metadata={'source': '250', 'page': '113'}, page_content='However, Schneider Electric, \nlike other companies, is confronted by that reality.

The triage of misconduct reports is primarily \nmanaged by the Regional Compliance Officer. Upon receipt of \na\xa0concern, the Officer evaluates its validity based on predefined \ncriteria outlined in the Whistleblowing Policy. If the concern \nqualifies as a valid alert, it is promptly escalated for thorough \ninvestigation. However, if the concern does not meet the criteria, \nit\xa0is closed, and the reporter is directed to the relevant organization \nfor assistance. In cases where the Officer requires further \ninformation to conduct the triage effectively, they may request \nadditional details from the reporter. However, if there is no response \nfrom the reporter after two reminders and/or three weeks following \nthe receipt of the concern, the case may be closed. Furthermore, collaboration with partner organizations such as \nHuman Resources, Internal Audit and Finance is integral to the \nprocess, especially in cases where their expertise and involvement \nare necessary for a comprehensive resolution. Once a concern is identified as an alert, the Regional Compliance \nOfficer undertakes two critical actions: \n• Firstly, to determine the type of alert based on the definitions \noutlined in the Whistleblowing Policy; and\n• Secondly, to classify the case according to the severity \ncriteria\xa0specified in an Appendix of the Whistleblowing Policy. The Regional Compliance Officer does so with impartiality \nand\xa0confidentiality. Depending on this classification, low and medium cases are \nmanaged by the relevant Regional Compliance Officer at the \nregional level, while high and critical cases are overseen at global \nlevel by a member of the Group Operational Compliance \nCommittee. It is important to note that the classification of a case \nmay evolve during the investigation process. Subsequently, the appointed Case Manager takes charge of \ndeciding the investigative approach, either by leading it directly, \nassigning a dedicated investigation team, or appointing an external \ninvestigator. In order to properly manage all situations, the Case \nManagement & Investigation Policy sets out rules to make this \ndecision with impartiality in order to make sure decision-making \nis\xa0done objectively and in autonomy from chain of management \ninvolved in prevention and detection of corruption or bribery.

The evaluation of this is undertaken and supported by review of \nrelevant documentations. If the requirements are effectively \nincorporated in the policies and processes, the supplier can be \ncounted as conforming to DWP in the KPI calculation. Otherwise, \nit\xa0is still counted as non-compliant regarding the requirements of \nthe program.

The program requires strategic suppliers to develop a proactive \npolicy as a means to extend safe, attractive and inclusive \nworkplace to their employees. Criteria defined for each Decent \nWork pillar may also overlap with ISO\xa026000 standard and are \nvalidated by the Global Procurement, Human Resources, Supply \nChain, and Sustainability teams. The suppliers will be assessed through remote questionnaires \nsupported by relevant documentation, as well as on-site visits and \nspot audits, and their performance will be monitored by experts. All \nquestions have a minimum acceptable answer defined. Suppliers \nresponses will be evaluated against the minimum acceptable \ncriteria to qualify as Decent Work compliant. Program deployment \nis ensured by specialists of Sustainable Procurement from Global \nProcurement function, who are responsible to onboard, train, and \nassess suppliers. The program implementation is supported by the \nGlobal Procurement Services. Through DWP, Schneider aims to enhance social integration, \nequity, security, dignity, satisfaction, and overall improvement in the \nquality of life for the workers, and their family. For a supplier to fully \nadhere to the DWP, the Global Procurement team will look at \ninclusion of the requirements in the supplier’s organizational \nframework by means of policies, processes etc. Incase of missing \nor non alignment, the suppliers need to initiate corrective measures \nwhich aim to institutionalise the requirements within the company. The evaluation of this is undertaken and supported by review of \nrelevant documentations. If the requirements are effectively \nincorporated in the policies and processes, the supplier can be \ncounted as conforming to DWP in the KPI calculation. Otherwise, \nit\xa0is still counted as non-compliant regarding the requirements of \nthe program.

Schneider Electric firmly \nbelieves that well-being generates performance and performance \ngenerates well-being. Well-being can be a unique competitive advantage if tackled \nproperly and genuinely. Schneider has identified three main risks \naround those topics:\n• Poor working conditions may result in psycho-social risks. • Market research shows that well-being at work is on a persistent \ndecline, hitting minority groups harder. • Employee engagement, performance, and retention are at risk \nwhen employee well-being is deteriorating. On the flip side, the opportunities are huge when inclusion and \ncare are by design in all processes and behaviors:\n• Figures on stress and psychological risks, from Ecole du Stress \nshows that for every 1 euro invested in well-being prevention \nprograms and practices, a company saves 2.2 euros. • A study from Forbes (“The Future of Work Depends on \nSupporting Gen Z”) shows that overall, DEI and well-being are \nstrong drivers of attraction and retention among all generations, \nespecially the younger ones. Schneider Electric defines its strategy taking into consideration \nthose risks and opportunities, internal and external trends, insights \nand feedback from leaders and employees, and its desire to \ncontinue nurturing an inclusive and caring environment. Since \n2020, the Trust Charter included a chapter on well-being and new \nways of\xa0working, highlighting behaviors expected from managers \nand employees. Working organisation\nPolicy\nGlobal Family Leave Policy\nAs a caring, inclusive, and responsible employer, Schneider \nlaunched its Global Family Leave policy along with care leave in \n2017. Through its policy, the Group supports employees with \npersonal time at critical life stages and empowers everyone to \nmanage their “unique life and work” to enable them to be at their \nbest. While countries have flexibility to define eligibility and policy \ndetails per statutory and/or market requirements, the policy \nestablishes a global minimum standard for paid leave. In 2023, the Group globally deployed the updated Global Family \nLeave Policy for all employees, where parental and care leave were \nincreased. Although the duration for bereavement leaves remained \nunchanged, the local adaptation was enhanced by adopting a \nflexible definition of “Immediate Family” in acknowledgment of the \ndiverse cultures and religions displayed by the global workforce. Schneider Electric’s Global Family Leave Policy was recognized by \nthe Brandon Hall Group in September 2023, receiving a Gold \nAward for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion – affirming the Group’s \nposition as a caring, inclusive, and responsible employer. Additional to the Group’s Global Family Leave Policy and, in \nsupport of global standards and local empowerment, back-up \nfamily care benefits are offered in some countries to assist \nemployees with family care needs when they experience disruption \nin regular care arrangements. In the absence of a Group-level \nback-up family care policy, the Group highlights examples of \nback-up family care benefits that are offered at the country level. Globally, the Group also offers an Employee Assistance Program \nwith coverage in over 90% of its operating countries which \nprovides\xa0additional support and resources for mental well-being \nand family care. Beyond the Global Family Leave Policy and Employee Assistance \nProgram, some countries where Schneider Electric operates \nprovide support in the form of on-site childcare facilities, childcare \ncontributions, and breast-feeding and lactation benefits.

Risks and opportunities arising from impacts \nand dependencies on own workforce\nWorking conditions\nThe Group identifies operational risks such as strikes, loss of \nproductivity, and resignations as potential risks. Legal risks include \npotential fines from lawsuits, duty of care infringement, and \nnon-compliance with mandatory benefit requirements and \nworkplace violations, which could lead to a loss of business. Reputational risks arise from NGO demands on freedom of \nassociation and media exposure. Social negotiations may increase \noperational costs.

The Philips Fair Employment Policy details the ethical and social principles that govern the \ncompany’s relationship with its employees and other workers worldwide. The policy promotes \ntransparency, accountability, and a positive work environment and is aimed at creating a fair and \nequal workplace.

Note IV Workforce of the future\nAs reflected in our ESG commitments, we aim to be the best place to work for our employees, \nproviding opportunities for learning and development, promoting an inclusive workplace, and \nassuring a safe and healthy work environment. Our commitments to our people are observed in \naccordance with our General Business Principles, Speak Up, Human Rights, Occupational Health & \nSafety, Fair Employment, and Diversity & Inclusion policies. We continued our Total Workforce Strategy, which considers all sources of skills, capabilities, \nlocations and changes in the labor market in order to deliver the Workforce of the Future. Globally, \nwe work with different worker types: employees and contingent workers, as well external services. In 2024, we further focused on the implementation of our external workforce strategy. In addition, \nwe have been looking at how we are attracting contingent workforce talent. Direct sourcing has \nbeen expanded to 26% in the Netherlands and to 40% in the US, and has been rolled out to India \n(11%). To strengthen the way we directly source contingent workforce talent, our own Philips \nemployer value proposition is utilized for the different functions to attract these contingent \nworkers. Total Workforce Strategy\nWe use our Right Shoring & Sourcing methodology to implement the Total Workforce Strategy. This methodology steers improvements in workforce composition towards the ‘right \nshore’ (onshore, nearshore and offshore) and the ‘right source’ (employees, contingent workers \nand external services). The program delivered EUR 7 million in savings in 2024. To develop the workforce that can deliver our strategy we have a Strategic Priorities recruitment \nteam who focus on the R&D, Patient Safety & Quality, Clinical and Informatics roles critical to our \nsuccess. Together, in 2024, they delivered 1,555 roles. In all of our external recruitment we secured \n38% candidates with Medical Technology expertise. Talent attraction\nIn 2024, we continued to recruit the talent we need to deliver our strategy, filling 11,391 positions \nacross the organization, of which 30% were internal hires. For external recruitment our strategic \nhiring channels of Direct Sourcing (headhunting) and Referrals delivered 33% of our new joiners to \nPhilips. Through collaboration with the Tent Partnership for Refugees, we continue to offer opportunities \nto refugees across our operations. In 2024, we hired 120 refugees across the globe including the \nfirst hires in the US, and we kicked off this refugee program roll-out in Mexico. We have been \ncontinuing Tent’s Mentorship Program for Hispanic Refugees in the US and the Refugee Women in \nthe US and EMEA. 2024 saw a further strengthening of our strategic Employer Branding efforts, alongside an \nexpanded approach to Talent Marketing that now holistically addresses talent engagement. Externally, we advanced our talent attraction strategy through targeted media campaigns focused \non critical talent segments and strategic capabilities such as Tech, Sales & Commercial, and Quality \n& Regulatory professionals. These efforts resulted in a 62% increase in unique visitors to our \nCareers website per job posting, and a 43% boost in applications per job requisition compared to \n2023. Our ongoing employer branding content program continued across multiple channels, reinforcing \nour position as a purpose-driven health technology company dedicated to patient safety, quality, \nand sustainability. This helped us solidify our reputation as an equal-opportunity employer of \nchoice. Notably, our marketing metrics showed double-digit growth in interest and favorability \ntoward our employer brand compared to the previous year. On LinkedIn, our key media channel, by leveraging personal stories and emotionally resonant video \ncontent, we established a distinctive, people-centric positioning that vividly showcases our culture \nof impact with care for people, patients, and the planet. In recognition of our efforts, we were honored at the 2024 Employer Brand Management Awards \nfor best aligning our Employer Value Proposition with our corporate brand values.

Philips diversity metrics methodology:\nPhilips prepares diversity metrics (gender in senior management and age distribution) using the \nPhilips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of employees, and Workday reports. Philips defines senior management as Corporate Grade 90 (senior director) and above, which does \nnot differ from previous description. Philips defines management as Corporate Grade 80 (director) \nand Corporate Grade 90 (senior director). The distribution of employees by age group is split into \nthree categories: under 30 years old; 30-50 years old; over 50 years old. Persons with disability uses the Philips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of \nemployees. Disability data is collected manually in countries where we operate with headcount. In \nsome countries disability is registered through self-identification, while in others it is registered with \nmedical documentation. Philips adheres to the local legislation and regulations when defining, \nregistering and disclosing information on persons with disabilities among employees, as well as \nwhen setting local strategies and targets. Due to the localized nature of the metric, there is no \nconsistent global process in place to collect or validate the data, and official medical records are not \na requirement across all countries. Work-life balance data is collected manually in countries where we operate with headcount and \nuses Philips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of employees. Work-life balance \ndata on entitled employees who took family-related leave is collected from our largest countries by \nheadcount and further estimated. Note VI Employee engagement\nOur People Engagement Survey (PES) saw increased participation, leading to a response rate of \n84%, which means that almost 58,000 employees participated.

Our purpose is to improve people’s \nhealth and well-being, and therefore, we value a safe work environment and the health and well-\nbeing of our employees. As we strive to look after the physical and mental health of our people, \nthe H&S Leadership team embarked on a learning journey for further improvement in 2024. The \nteam conducted a thorough review of internal and external H&S audit findings, conducted \ninterviews with a wide range of stakeholders in the company, carried out SWOT analysis, and \nreviewed and prioritized key focus areas. This information was used to develop a H&S strategic \nroadmap 2025-2030. In 2024, the following key strategic programs were identified to drive further execution to our \nvision:\n• Leadership-led safety culture to further drive accountability and ownership for people safety. • Standardization and simplification of Philips’ Corporate Safety Standards (PCSS) to allow for \nprioritized risk management and consistent implementation of H&S minimum requirements \nworldwide. This includes providing guidance notes, templates, best practices, training \ndocuments and work instructions.'), Document(id='88e14700-7a19-4a68-840f-43cee81c9acd', metadata={'source': '585', 'page': '243'}, page_content='8.7 \nESRS cross-reference table\nESRS 2 \nGeneral disclosures\nDisclosure Requirement BP-1 – General basis for preparation of sustainability\nSustainability statement: General basis for preparation\n169 Limited Assurance\nDisclosure Requirement BP-2 – Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances\nSustainability statement: General basis for preparation\n169 Limited Assurance\nDisclosure Requirement GOV-1 – The role of the administrative, management and \nsupervisory bodies\nSFDR/BRR\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance: ESG governance\nSupervisory Board report: composition, diversity and self-evaluation\nOther Board-related matters: Diversity\n40\n64\n268\nLimited Assurance\nDisclosure Requirement GOV-2 – Information provided to and sustainability matters \naddressed by the undertaking’s administrative, management and supervisory bodies\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance: ESG governance\n40 Limited Assurance\nDisclosure Requirement GOV-3 - Integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive \nschemes\nRemuneration Report: Non-financial Annual Incentive\nRemuneration Report: Long-term Sustainability objectives\n76\n80\nLimited Assurance\nDisclosure Requirement GOV-4 - Statement on due diligence\nSFDR\nESG governance, strategy and policies: Governance\n170 Limited Assurance\nDisclosure Requirement GOV-5 - Risk management and internal controls over sustainability \nreporting\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance: ESG governance\nGovernance: Financial reporting and sustainability reporting\n40\n58\nLimited Assurance\nDisclosure Requirement SBM-1 – Strategy, business model and value chain\nSFDR/P3/BRR\nGovernance: Working with stakeholders and advocacy\nESG governance, strategy and policies: Strategy\n54\n170\nLimited Assurance\nDisclosure Requirement SBM-2 – Interests and views of stakeholders\nGovernance: Working with stakeholders and advocacy\nESG governance, strategy and policies: Strategy\n54\n170\nLimited Assurance\nDisclosure Requirement SBM-3 - Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their \ninteraction with strategy and business model\nGovernance: Working with stakeholders and advocacy\nESG governance, strategy and policies: Strategy\nSustainability statement: IRO Table\n54\n170\n174\nReasonable \nAssurance\nDisclosure Requirement IRO-1 - Description of the processes to identify and assess material \nimpacts, risks and opportunities\nSustainability statement: Double Materiality Assessment\n171 Reasonable \nAssurance\nDisclosure Requirement IRO-2 – Disclosure requirements in ESRS covered by the \nundertaking’s sustainability statement\nSustainability statement: Double Materiality Assessment\n171 Limited Assurance\nMinimum disclosure requirement - Policies MDR-P – Policies adopted to manage material \nsustainability matters\nESG governance, strategy and policies: Policies\nDouble Materiality Assessment: Policy Overview\n171\n180\n4\nMinimum disclosure requirement - Actions MDR-A – Actions and resources in relation to \nmaterial sustainability matters\nESG governance, strategy and policies: Actions\n171 ⁴\nMinimum disclosure requirement – Metrics MDR-M – Metrics in relation to material \nsustainability matters\nSustainability statement: Tracking our 2025 ESG program\nSustainability statement: Double Materiality Assessment\n166\n171\n⁴\nMinimum disclosure requirement – Targets MDR-T – Tracking effectiveness of policies and \nactions through targets\nSustainability statement: Tracking our 2025 ESG program\nSustainability statement: Double Materiality Assessment\n166\n171\n⁴\nCSRD Topic1\nCSRD Disclosure requirement\nOther EU legislation2\nReference\nPages3 Assurance level\nContents\n1 Our Management\n2 Strategy\n3 Financial performance\n4 Environmental, Social and Governance\n5 Supervisory Board\n6 Group financial statements\n7 Company financial statements\n8 Sustainability statement\n9 Further information\n243\n1 \nDisclosure requirements and related datapoints derived from other EU legislation listed in Appendix B of ESRS 2 which Philips deems material have been included in the cross-reference table\n2  \nEU Climate Law (EUCL), Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), Climate Benchmark Standards Regulation (BRR), EBA Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements (P3) \n3 \nThe page references a specific element of information which addresses the relevant datapoint prescribed by the corresponding Disclosure Requirement\n4 \nFor the level of assurance EY provides for each element of MDR, we refer to the topical sections where the MDRs are related to for the applicable assurance level\n'), Document(id='1be648a6-e6e3-4384-ac06-e08e71c0c840', metadata={'source': '409', 'page': '181'}, page_content=""Provide all employees with fair and equal development opportunities.

Note IV Workforce of the future\nAs reflected in our ESG commitments, we aim to be the best place to work for our employees, \nproviding opportunities for learning and development, promoting an inclusive workplace, and \nassuring a safe and healthy work environment. Our commitments to our people are observed in \naccordance with our General Business Principles, Speak Up, Human Rights, Occupational Health & \nSafety, Fair Employment, and Diversity & Inclusion policies. We continued our Total Workforce Strategy, which considers all sources of skills, capabilities, \nlocations and changes in the labor market in order to deliver the Workforce of the Future. Globally, \nwe work with different worker types: employees and contingent workers, as well external services. In 2024, we further focused on the implementation of our external workforce strategy. In addition, \nwe have been looking at how we are attracting contingent workforce talent. Direct sourcing has \nbeen expanded to 26% in the Netherlands and to 40% in the US, and has been rolled out to India \n(11%). To strengthen the way we directly source contingent workforce talent, our own Philips \nemployer value proposition is utilized for the different functions to attract these contingent \nworkers. Total Workforce Strategy\nWe use our Right Shoring & Sourcing methodology to implement the Total Workforce Strategy. This methodology steers improvements in workforce composition towards the ‘right \nshore’ (onshore, nearshore and offshore) and the ‘right source’ (employees, contingent workers \nand external services). The program delivered EUR 7 million in savings in 2024. To develop the workforce that can deliver our strategy we have a Strategic Priorities recruitment \nteam who focus on the R&D, Patient Safety & Quality, Clinical and Informatics roles critical to our \nsuccess. Together, in 2024, they delivered 1,555 roles. In all of our external recruitment we secured \n38% candidates with Medical Technology expertise. Talent attraction\nIn 2024, we continued to recruit the talent we need to deliver our strategy, filling 11,391 positions \nacross the organization, of which 30% were internal hires. For external recruitment our strategic \nhiring channels of Direct Sourcing (headhunting) and Referrals delivered 33% of our new joiners to \nPhilips. Through collaboration with the Tent Partnership for Refugees, we continue to offer opportunities \nto refugees across our operations. In 2024, we hired 120 refugees across the globe including the \nfirst hires in the US, and we kicked off this refugee program roll-out in Mexico. We have been \ncontinuing Tent’s Mentorship Program for Hispanic Refugees in the US and the Refugee Women in \nthe US and EMEA. 2024 saw a further strengthening of our strategic Employer Branding efforts, alongside an \nexpanded approach to Talent Marketing that now holistically addresses talent engagement. Externally, we advanced our talent attraction strategy through targeted media campaigns focused \non critical talent segments and strategic capabilities such as Tech, Sales & Commercial, and Quality \n& Regulatory professionals. These efforts resulted in a 62% increase in unique visitors to our \nCareers website per job posting, and a 43% boost in applications per job requisition compared to \n2023. Our ongoing employer branding content program continued across multiple channels, reinforcing \nour position as a purpose-driven health technology company dedicated to patient safety, quality, \nand sustainability. This helped us solidify our reputation as an equal-opportunity employer of \nchoice. Notably, our marketing metrics showed double-digit growth in interest and favorability \ntoward our employer brand compared to the previous year. On LinkedIn, our key media channel, by leveraging personal stories and emotionally resonant video \ncontent, we established a distinctive, people-centric positioning that vividly showcases our culture \nof impact with care for people, patients, and the planet. In recognition of our efforts, we were honored at the 2024 Employer Brand Management Awards \nfor best aligning our Employer Value Proposition with our corporate brand values.

The latter includes the process of how \nPhilips assessed IROs, specifically related to pollution, water, and biodiversity for own sites and \nbusiness activities. Next, three sub-topics from ESRS S1 were assessed to be not material to Philips: \nchild labor, forced labor and adequate housing. Philips did not explicitly consult with affected \ncommunities as we deemed our current stakeholder consultation process to be sufficient. The results were calibrated and approved by our Board of Management and the other Executive \nCommittee members, followed by the Supervisory Board. During the calibration sessions, the financial materiality of most of the Environmental topics \nincreased compared with the initial assessment. On the Social topics, the financial impact of Human \nrights increased the most, followed by Fair & inclusive workplace. Product responsibility & safety, \nGeopolitical events, Big data, AI and cybersecurity, and Business ethics & general business principles \nwere assessed to have the highest financial materiality, similar to 2023. Overall, the impact materiality of the resulting topics did not change significantly compared to the \n2023 DMA. Philips has not identified any actual material risks and opportunities meaning that the risks and \nopportunities identified as an outcome of Philips' DMA process do not have any current financial \neffects on Philips' financial position, cash flows, and carrying value of assets and liabilities reported \nin the financial statements within the next annual reporting period. The material topics are monitored regularly. The 2024 DMA also serves as input for the \ndevelopment of our 2030 ESG program. Assessing these material topics enables us to prioritize and \naddress these in our policies, programs, targets and actions, and address the material impacts, risks, \nand opportunities with full consideration of the interests of the key stakeholders, such as end-users.

Impact, risk and opportunity management\nIn this section, Philips’ nature risk assessment approach (including risks related to resource use and \ncircular economy), and the results of this assessment, will be explained. Philips nature risk assessment approach\nPhilips recognizes the importance of identifying, assessing and mitigating nature-related risks to \nensure business continuity and resilience. The Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures \n(TNFD) report provides information needed by investors, lenders, insurance underwriters, and other \nstakeholders to appropriately assess nature-related risks and opportunities, including those related \nto ESRS E5. To identify and evaluate our impacts and dependencies (actual and potential) and assess related \nrisks and opportunities related to resource use and circular economy, we applied the Locate, \nEvaluate, Assess, and Prepare (LEAP) approach, in line with the recommended approach of TNFD. This approach constitutes four stages: Locate (Philips’ interface with nature), Evaluate (Philips’ \ndependencies and impacts on nature), Assess (Philips’ nature-related risks and opportunities) and \nPrepare (to respond to and report on material nature-related issues). This is also aligned with the \nrecommended disclosures for Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). As part of the Locate stage, we determined the scope of our risk and opportunities assessment \nincludes Philips’ businesses, regions, and functions focusing on Philips’ 23 manufacturing sites. To \napply the LEAP approach, Philips used multiple available tools such as an external risk insurance tool \n(Munich Re), the Ecosystem Intelligence tool (Ecometrix), and the Philips EP&L. Local teams at our \nmanufacturing sites were involved in the impact assessment to identify high priority nature-related \nrisks and opportunities. As part of the improvement opportunities in developing the LEAP \napproach, we aim to expand the consultations with local affected stakeholders in the coming years. Philips nature risk assessment results\nIn the Evaluate stage, the dependencies analysis results showed dependencies on the ecosystem \nservices like resource extraction. While resource extraction occurs outside the scope of our \nmanufacturing sites, we further assessed its dependencies and impacts on material flows based on \n2023 EP&L data. See Philips material flows for more information. The highest dependencies \nidentified are: Paper & Cardboard (29%), Plastics (29%) and Metals (21%). In terms of materials \ntype, the highest impacts are caused by metals (including processing) (37%), PCBs (33%), and \nelectronics components (10%).

These changes may elevate third-party dependency \nrisks regarding the delivery of IT services, the availability of IT systems, and the functionality offered \nby IT systems. Although Philips has sought to strengthen security measures and quality controls \nrelated to these systems, these measures may prove to be insufficient or unsuccessful, which may \nlead to a material adverse impact on Philips’ business, financial condition, and operating results. Risk response: Philips’ processes are captured in our process framework, where we manage end-to-\nend connections and define the critical process elements. The process framework provides the \nfoundation for all our management systems, including quality, environmental, and health and \nsafety, to ensure a compliant approach for processes, systems, data and competencies for a specific \nmanagement area. Philips uses structured IT risk management methodologies to identify and address risks to our \ncritical business applications.

Philips fully supports and complies with the \nOECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected \nand High-Risk Areas (OECD Guidance). The Supplier Sustainability Declaration (SSD) sets out the standards and behaviors Philips requires \nfrom its suppliers.

The Code is in alignment \nwith the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and key international human rights \nstandards, including the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the UN \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. It covers topics such as Forced Labor, Child Labor, Human \nTrafficking, Health & Safety, Environment, Ethics, and Management Systems. The RBA is the \nworld’s largest industry coalition dedicated to responsible business conduct in global supply chains. As a Regular member of the RBA, Philips is required to commit publicly to the RBA Code of \nConduct and actively pursue conformance to the Code and its standards, which must be regarded \nas a total supply chain initiative. The Regulated Substances List (RSL)\nThe RSL specifies the chemical substances regulated by legislation. Suppliers are required to follow \nall the requirements stated in the RSL. Substances are marked as restricted or declarable. All suppliers are required to commit to the SSD and RSL. Through integration of a Sustainability \nAgreement in our purchasing agreements, suppliers declare compliance to both the SSD and RSL. Upon request, they provide additional information and evidence. Risks and Vulnerable Groups\nPhilips utilizes a Risk Assessment Platform as a fundamental component of its risk assessment \nmodel. The platform employs a dynamic scoring method, which assesses regions across five critical \nsupply chain pillars: Labor, Health and Safety, Environment, Business Ethics, and Management \nSystems. The scoring method utilizes several indices with data from verified and reputable public \nsources to generate a final score, including but not limited to the Workers Rights Index \n(International Trade Union Confederation), Children’s Rights in the Workplace Index (UNICEF and \nGlobal Child Forum), Global Slavery Index - Proportion in Slavery and Vulnerability (Walk Free \nFoundation). Through this methodology, each region is assigned a risk score and categorized into \none of four risk bands: Extreme risk, High risk, Medium risk, or Low risk. These data-driven insights, \npresented in the form of risk maps, enable Philips to strategically focus its efforts to enhance supply \nchain sustainability while improving the lives of workers within the value chain. Philips recognizes the need to prioritize ethical business practices and mitigate risks associated with \nsuppliers located in countries classified as extreme risk. Philips acknowledges the complexities \ninherent in its operations, particularly concerning its ambitions to provide access to care for all. In \nthe limited instances where we do procure from extreme risk countries, we implement additional \ncontrols and due diligence measures to mitigate risks for workers within the value chain, ensuring \nalignment with ethical standards and sustainability commitments. Philips has proactively enrolled \nsuppliers from these countries in its Beyond Auditing program to assess them against rigorous \nstandards and foster collaborative efforts towards continuous improvement. Leveraging insights \nfrom Beyond Auditing assessments in high-risk countries and embracing technological \nadvancements such as AI and predictive analytics, Philips is committed to expanding the enrollment \nof suppliers from other geographies. This strategic approach underscores Philips’ commitment to \nenhancing supply chain sustainability and driving positive change.

Note IV Workforce of the future\nAs reflected in our ESG commitments, we aim to be the best place to work for our employees, \nproviding opportunities for learning and development, promoting an inclusive workplace, and \nassuring a safe and healthy work environment. Our commitments to our people are observed in \naccordance with our General Business Principles, Speak Up, Human Rights, Occupational Health & \nSafety, Fair Employment, and Diversity & Inclusion policies. We continued our Total Workforce Strategy, which considers all sources of skills, capabilities, \nlocations and changes in the labor market in order to deliver the Workforce of the Future. Globally, \nwe work with different worker types: employees and contingent workers, as well external services. In 2024, we further focused on the implementation of our external workforce strategy. In addition, \nwe have been looking at how we are attracting contingent workforce talent. Direct sourcing has \nbeen expanded to 26% in the Netherlands and to 40% in the US, and has been rolled out to India \n(11%). To strengthen the way we directly source contingent workforce talent, our own Philips \nemployer value proposition is utilized for the different functions to attract these contingent \nworkers. Total Workforce Strategy\nWe use our Right Shoring & Sourcing methodology to implement the Total Workforce Strategy. This methodology steers improvements in workforce composition towards the ‘right \nshore’ (onshore, nearshore and offshore) and the ‘right source’ (employees, contingent workers \nand external services). The program delivered EUR 7 million in savings in 2024. To develop the workforce that can deliver our strategy we have a Strategic Priorities recruitment \nteam who focus on the R&D, Patient Safety & Quality, Clinical and Informatics roles critical to our \nsuccess. Together, in 2024, they delivered 1,555 roles. In all of our external recruitment we secured \n38% candidates with Medical Technology expertise. Talent attraction\nIn 2024, we continued to recruit the talent we need to deliver our strategy, filling 11,391 positions \nacross the organization, of which 30% were internal hires. For external recruitment our strategic \nhiring channels of Direct Sourcing (headhunting) and Referrals delivered 33% of our new joiners to \nPhilips. Through collaboration with the Tent Partnership for Refugees, we continue to offer opportunities \nto refugees across our operations. In 2024, we hired 120 refugees across the globe including the \nfirst hires in the US, and we kicked off this refugee program roll-out in Mexico. We have been \ncontinuing Tent’s Mentorship Program for Hispanic Refugees in the US and the Refugee Women in \nthe US and EMEA. 2024 saw a further strengthening of our strategic Employer Branding efforts, alongside an \nexpanded approach to Talent Marketing that now holistically addresses talent engagement. Externally, we advanced our talent attraction strategy through targeted media campaigns focused \non critical talent segments and strategic capabilities such as Tech, Sales & Commercial, and Quality \n& Regulatory professionals. These efforts resulted in a 62% increase in unique visitors to our \nCareers website per job posting, and a 43% boost in applications per job requisition compared to \n2023. Our ongoing employer branding content program continued across multiple channels, reinforcing \nour position as a purpose-driven health technology company dedicated to patient safety, quality, \nand sustainability. This helped us solidify our reputation as an equal-opportunity employer of \nchoice. Notably, our marketing metrics showed double-digit growth in interest and favorability \ntoward our employer brand compared to the previous year. On LinkedIn, our key media channel, by leveraging personal stories and emotionally resonant video \ncontent, we established a distinctive, people-centric positioning that vividly showcases our culture \nof impact with care for people, patients, and the planet. In recognition of our efforts, we were honored at the 2024 Employer Brand Management Awards \nfor best aligning our Employer Value Proposition with our corporate brand values.

Our \nachievements in 2024 included prestigious accolades such as Forbes Best Employers for Women, \nForbes World’s Best Employer, Financial Times Best Employer for Diversity, and a top rating on the \nHuman Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. These recognitions underscore our ongoing \ndedication to fostering an inclusive and equitable workplace. External partnerships\nAs we continue to focus on integrating inclusion, belonging and equity into the employee \nexperience, we see value in partnering with diverse professional network organizations and job \nboards to sharpen our focus on the development and retention of our internal diverse talent and \nincreasing representation of diverse talent across our organization. In 2024, we renewed a \npartnership with the National Black MBA Association and introduced partnerships with the National \nSales Network, Circa, Mogul and Rise and Lead. Philips diversity metrics methodology:\nPhilips prepares diversity metrics (gender in senior management and age distribution) using the \nPhilips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of employees, and Workday reports. Philips defines senior management as Corporate Grade 90 (senior director) and above, which does \nnot differ from previous description. Philips defines management as Corporate Grade 80 (director) \nand Corporate Grade 90 (senior director). The distribution of employees by age group is split into \nthree categories: under 30 years old; 30-50 years old; over 50 years old. Persons with disability uses the Philips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of \nemployees. Disability data is collected manually in countries where we operate with headcount. In \nsome countries disability is registered through self-identification, while in others it is registered with \nmedical documentation. Philips adheres to the local legislation and regulations when defining, \nregistering and disclosing information on persons with disabilities among employees, as well as \nwhen setting local strategies and targets. Due to the localized nature of the metric, there is no \nconsistent global process in place to collect or validate the data, and official medical records are not \na requirement across all countries. Work-life balance data is collected manually in countries where we operate with headcount and \nuses Philips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of employees. Work-life balance \ndata on entitled employees who took family-related leave is collected from our largest countries by \nheadcount and further estimated. Note VI Employee engagement\nOur People Engagement Survey (PES) saw increased participation, leading to a response rate of \n84%, which means that almost 58,000 employees participated. The PES is a key component of our listening strategy, informing our Business and People strategy \non employee sentiment and potential impacts, risks and opportunities. The results are taken up by \nthe Executive Committee and further cascaded for follow-up actions in their organizations and \nteams, informing how we work and areas in need of attention.'), Document(id='3143860d-dab3-4912-8576-b46ae17f961c', metadata={'source': '513', 'page': '218'}, page_content='Training hours data is prepared using consolidated reporting from our four learning systems. Note V Diversity, Inclusion and Well-Being\nWe are a diverse team made up of 68,419 individuals across over 70 countries, all with different \nbackgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. We fully value and leverage these differences to \nensure that creativity and innovation can flourish. In our ongoing effort to increase transparency and develop leadership through non-discriminatory \nmeans, we share data on the representation of women throughout our Businesses, Regions and \nFunctions, including a quarterly review with the Executive Committee.

These recognitions underscore our ongoing \ndedication to fostering an inclusive and equitable workplace. External partnerships\nAs we continue to focus on integrating inclusion, belonging and equity into the employee \nexperience, we see value in partnering with diverse professional network organizations and job \nboards to sharpen our focus on the development and retention of our internal diverse talent and \nincreasing representation of diverse talent across our organization. In 2024, we renewed a \npartnership with the National Black MBA Association and introduced partnerships with the National \nSales Network, Circa, Mogul and Rise and Lead. Philips diversity metrics methodology:\nPhilips prepares diversity metrics (gender in senior management and age distribution) using the \nPhilips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of employees, and Workday reports. Philips defines senior management as Corporate Grade 90 (senior director) and above, which does \nnot differ from previous description. Philips defines management as Corporate Grade 80 (director) \nand Corporate Grade 90 (senior director). The distribution of employees by age group is split into \nthree categories: under 30 years old; 30-50 years old; over 50 years old. Persons with disability uses the Philips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of \nemployees. Disability data is collected manually in countries where we operate with headcount. In \nsome countries disability is registered through self-identification, while in others it is registered with \nmedical documentation. Philips adheres to the local legislation and regulations when defining, \nregistering and disclosing information on persons with disabilities among employees, as well as \nwhen setting local strategies and targets. Due to the localized nature of the metric, there is no \nconsistent global process in place to collect or validate the data, and official medical records are not \na requirement across all countries. Work-life balance data is collected manually in countries where we operate with headcount and \nuses Philips employee definition, in line with the ESRS definition of employees. Work-life balance \ndata on entitled employees who took family-related leave is collected from our largest countries by \nheadcount and further estimated. Note VI Employee engagement\nOur People Engagement Survey (PES) saw increased participation, leading to a response rate of \n84%, which means that almost 58,000 employees participated. The PES is a key component of our listening strategy, informing our Business and People strategy \non employee sentiment and potential impacts, risks and opportunities. The results are taken up by \nthe Executive Committee and further cascaded for follow-up actions in their organizations and \nteams, informing how we work and areas in need of attention.'), Document(id='6fd2af24-6e6b-474c-bd0a-f1284fc89e87', metadata={'source': '398', 'page': '176'}, page_content=""Fair & Inclusive \nworkplace\n(ESRS S1)\nMaterial positive \nimpact, \nmaterial \nopportunity \nPhilips makes a positive impact on employees by \npromoting an inclusive workplace, where all employees \nand other workers feel valued and respected. òòò\nGeneral Business \nPrinciples,\nDiversity & \nInclusion Policy,\nFair Employment \nPolicy\nNote V\nNote VII\nNote XII\nS1-6 – Characteristics of the \nundertaking’s employees\nS1-7 – Characteristics of non-\nemployee workers in the \nundertaking’s own workforce\nS1-9 – Diversity metrics\nS1-12– Persons with disabilities\nS1-16 – Compensation metrics \n(pay gap and total \ncompensation)\nEntity specific:\nWomen in leadership positions\nEmployee Engagement Index\np¢q\nWomen in \nleadership \npositions\n% of senior \nmanagement \npositions\n35%\nPhilips has an opportunity to support and strengthen \nemployee belonging and employment engagement by \nproviding a fair, safe and respectful treatment for all \nemployees in employment practices, compensation and \nan inspiring place to work and grow. òòò\nEmployee \nEngagement \nIndex\n%\nN/A\nEmployee rights\n(ESRS S1)\nMaterial positive \nimpact, \nmaterial risk\nPhilips has positive impacts on employees by respecting \nemployee rights, providing at least a living wage to all \nemployees, providing fair employment, providing fair \nand equal opportunities for development, and \nrespecting employees' right to organize and collective \nbargaining. òòò\nGeneral Business \nPrinciples,\nSpeakUp Policy,\nFair Employment \nPolicy,\nHuman Rights \nPolicy\nNote VIII\nNote XII\nS1-8 – Collective bargaining \ncoverage and social dialogue\nS1-10 – Adequate wages\nS1-11 – Social protection\nEntity specific:\nPhilips pays its employees at \nleast a living wage\np¢q\nWe pay at \nleast a living \nwage\n%\n100%\nRisk of fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage \nfor Philips due to Philips not adequately addressing \nemployee rights in their operations. òòò\nEmployee well-\nbeing, Health & \nSafety\n(ESRS S1)\nMaterial positive \nimpact, \nmaterial negative \nimpact,\nmaterial risk\nPhilips has a positive impact on employees' well-being \nas a result of providing a healthy work-life balance.""), Document(id='b8858e3d-6898-4130-b310-e091409059a6', metadata={'source': '514', 'page': '219'}, page_content='well-being, inclusion and equal employment opportunities.

Management of key material people topics (Impacts, Risks and Opportunities)\nWe depend on our people to deliver on our business strategy and our commitments to our \ncustomers, patients and consumers and therefore place a lot of importance on managing the risks \nand opportunities that pertain to our own workforce. We identify key impacts, risks, and opportunities around social topics, which inform our Business \nand People strategy through the DMA process, tracking our performance in key material topics, as \nwell as through our engagement with our people.

The Philips Fair Employment Policy details the ethical and social principles that govern the \ncompany’s relationship with its employees and other workers worldwide. The policy promotes \ntransparency, accountability, and a positive work environment and is aimed at creating a fair and \nequal workplace. In accordance with conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO), we \nare committed to be free from forced, bonded and child labor, which extends to human trafficking \nin line with our Human Rights commitments. The policy helps create an environment of inclusion \nand belonging, where all employees and other workers are treated fairly, free from discrimination, \nharassment, and other prohibited behaviors.'), Document(id='3b3732c2-2fdb-4300-a7a9-ce7df24c3295', metadata={'source': '159', 'page': '68'}, page_content='Finally, the \nCommittee reviewed the Charter of the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection \nCommittee and concluded it remains appropriate.

Note IV Workforce of the future\nAs reflected in our ESG commitments, we aim to be the best place to work for our employees, \nproviding opportunities for learning and development, promoting an inclusive workplace, and \nassuring a safe and healthy work environment. Our commitments to our people are observed in \naccordance with our General Business Principles, Speak Up, Human Rights, Occupational Health & \nSafety, Fair Employment, and Diversity & Inclusion policies. We continued our Total Workforce Strategy, which considers all sources of skills, capabilities, \nlocations and changes in the labor market in order to deliver the Workforce of the Future. Globally, \nwe work with different worker types: employees and contingent workers, as well external services. In 2024, we further focused on the implementation of our external workforce strategy. In addition, \nwe have been looking at how we are attracting contingent workforce talent. Direct sourcing has \nbeen expanded to 26% in the Netherlands and to 40% in the US, and has been rolled out to India \n(11%). To strengthen the way we directly source contingent workforce talent, our own Philips \nemployer value proposition is utilized for the different functions to attract these contingent \nworkers. Total Workforce Strategy\nWe use our Right Shoring & Sourcing methodology to implement the Total Workforce Strategy. This methodology steers improvements in workforce composition towards the ‘right \nshore’ (onshore, nearshore and offshore) and the ‘right source’ (employees, contingent workers \nand external services). The program delivered EUR 7 million in savings in 2024. To develop the workforce that can deliver our strategy we have a Strategic Priorities recruitment \nteam who focus on the R&D, Patient Safety & Quality, Clinical and Informatics roles critical to our \nsuccess. Together, in 2024, they delivered 1,555 roles. In all of our external recruitment we secured \n38% candidates with Medical Technology expertise. Talent attraction\nIn 2024, we continued to recruit the talent we need to deliver our strategy, filling 11,391 positions \nacross the organization, of which 30% were internal hires. For external recruitment our strategic \nhiring channels of Direct Sourcing (headhunting) and Referrals delivered 33% of our new joiners to \nPhilips. Through collaboration with the Tent Partnership for Refugees, we continue to offer opportunities \nto refugees across our operations. In 2024, we hired 120 refugees across the globe including the \nfirst hires in the US, and we kicked off this refugee program roll-out in Mexico. We have been \ncontinuing Tent’s Mentorship Program for Hispanic Refugees in the US and the Refugee Women in \nthe US and EMEA. 2024 saw a further strengthening of our strategic Employer Branding efforts, alongside an \nexpanded approach to Talent Marketing that now holistically addresses talent engagement. Externally, we advanced our talent attraction strategy through targeted media campaigns focused \non critical talent segments and strategic capabilities such as Tech, Sales & Commercial, and Quality \n& Regulatory professionals. These efforts resulted in a 62% increase in unique visitors to our \nCareers website per job posting, and a 43% boost in applications per job requisition compared to \n2023. Our ongoing employer branding content program continued across multiple channels, reinforcing \nour position as a purpose-driven health technology company dedicated to patient safety, quality, \nand sustainability. This helped us solidify our reputation as an equal-opportunity employer of \nchoice. Notably, our marketing metrics showed double-digit growth in interest and favorability \ntoward our employer brand compared to the previous year. On LinkedIn, our key media channel, by leveraging personal stories and emotionally resonant video \ncontent, we established a distinctive, people-centric positioning that vividly showcases our culture \nof impact with care for people, patients, and the planet. In recognition of our efforts, we were honored at the 2024 Employer Brand Management Awards \nfor best aligning our Employer Value Proposition with our corporate brand values.

We identify key impacts, risks, and opportunities around social topics, which inform our Business \nand People strategy through the DMA process, tracking our performance in key material topics, as \nwell as through our engagement with our people.

The Philips Fair Employment Policy details the ethical and social principles that govern the \ncompany’s relationship with its employees and other workers worldwide. The policy promotes \ntransparency, accountability, and a positive work environment and is aimed at creating a fair and \nequal workplace. In accordance with conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO), we \nare committed to be free from forced, bonded and child labor, which extends to human trafficking \nin line with our Human Rights commitments.

Our commitments to our people are observed in \naccordance with our General Business Principles, Speak Up, Human Rights, Occupational Health & \nSafety, Fair Employment, and Diversity & Inclusion policies. We continued our Total Workforce Strategy, which considers all sources of skills, capabilities, \nlocations and changes in the labor market in order to deliver the Workforce of the Future. Globally, \nwe work with different worker types: employees and contingent workers, as well external services. In 2024, we further focused on the implementation of our external workforce strategy. In addition, \nwe have been looking at how we are attracting contingent workforce talent. Direct sourcing has \nbeen expanded to 26% in the Netherlands and to 40% in the US, and has been rolled out to India \n(11%). To strengthen the way we directly source contingent workforce talent, our own Philips \nemployer value proposition is utilized for the different functions to attract these contingent \nworkers. Total Workforce Strategy\nWe use our Right Shoring & Sourcing methodology to implement the Total Workforce Strategy. This methodology steers improvements in workforce composition towards the ‘right \nshore’ (onshore, nearshore and offshore) and the ‘right source’ (employees, contingent workers \nand external services). The program delivered EUR 7 million in savings in 2024. To develop the workforce that can deliver our strategy we have a Strategic Priorities recruitment \nteam who focus on the R&D, Patient Safety & Quality, Clinical and Informatics roles critical to our \nsuccess. Together, in 2024, they delivered 1,555 roles. In all of our external recruitment we secured \n38% candidates with Medical Technology expertise. Talent attraction\nIn 2024, we continued to recruit the talent we need to deliver our strategy, filling 11,391 positions \nacross the organization, of which 30% were internal hires. For external recruitment our strategic \nhiring channels of Direct Sourcing (headhunting) and Referrals delivered 33% of our new joiners to \nPhilips. Through collaboration with the Tent Partnership for Refugees, we continue to offer opportunities \nto refugees across our operations. In 2024, we hired 120 refugees across the globe including the \nfirst hires in the US, and we kicked off this refugee program roll-out in Mexico. We have been \ncontinuing Tent’s Mentorship Program for Hispanic Refugees in the US and the Refugee Women in \nthe US and EMEA. 2024 saw a further strengthening of our strategic Employer Branding efforts, alongside an \nexpanded approach to Talent Marketing that now holistically addresses talent engagement. Externally, we advanced our talent attraction strategy through targeted media campaigns focused \non critical talent segments and strategic capabilities such as Tech, Sales & Commercial, and Quality \n& Regulatory professionals. These efforts resulted in a 62% increase in unique visitors to our \nCareers website per job posting, and a 43% boost in applications per job requisition compared to \n2023. Our ongoing employer branding content program continued across multiple channels, reinforcing \nour position as a purpose-driven health technology company dedicated to patient safety, quality, \nand sustainability. This helped us solidify our reputation as an equal-opportunity employer of \nchoice. Notably, our marketing metrics showed double-digit growth in interest and favorability \ntoward our employer brand compared to the previous year. On LinkedIn, our key media channel, by leveraging personal stories and emotionally resonant video \ncontent, we established a distinctive, people-centric positioning that vividly showcases our culture \nof impact with care for people, patients, and the planet. In recognition of our efforts, we were honored at the 2024 Employer Brand Management Awards \nfor best aligning our Employer Value Proposition with our corporate brand values.

In 2024, we hired 120 refugees across the globe including the \nfirst hires in the US, and we kicked off this refugee program roll-out in Mexico. We have been \ncontinuing Tent’s Mentorship Program for Hispanic Refugees in the US and the Refugee Women in \nthe US and EMEA. 2024 saw a further strengthening of our strategic Employer Branding efforts, alongside an \nexpanded approach to Talent Marketing that now holistically addresses talent engagement. Externally, we advanced our talent attraction strategy through targeted media campaigns focused \non critical talent segments and strategic capabilities such as Tech, Sales & Commercial, and Quality \n& Regulatory professionals. These efforts resulted in a 62% increase in unique visitors to our \nCareers website per job posting, and a 43% boost in applications per job requisition compared to \n2023. Our ongoing employer branding content program continued across multiple channels, reinforcing \nour position as a purpose-driven health technology company dedicated to patient safety, quality, \nand sustainability.

Notably, our marketing metrics showed double-digit growth in interest and favorability \ntoward our employer brand compared to the previous year. On LinkedIn, our key media channel, by leveraging personal stories and emotionally resonant video \ncontent, we established a distinctive, people-centric positioning that vividly showcases our culture \nof impact with care for people, patients, and the planet. In recognition of our efforts, we were honored at the 2024 Employer Brand Management Awards \nfor best aligning our Employer Value Proposition with our corporate brand values.

In the Netherlands, for example, we run a special employment \nprogram, WGP (Werkgelegenheidsplan, or Philips Employment Scheme), to offer vulnerable groups \nof external jobseekers a work experience placement, usually combined with training. Since the \nscheme’s launch in 1983, 13,475 people have participated, and around 80% found a regular job \nafter taking part. In 2024, we had an inflow of 60 candidates, bringing the total number of \nparticipants in 2024 to 118. The WGP program is also accessible to refugees, and in 2024 we had 9 \nrefugees participating. Note XI Health and Safety\nOutlook 2025-2030\nThe value of safety at work is changing, in light of the growing importance and corporate \nrecognition of environment, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability; mental and physical \nwell-being; psychological safety and human and organizational performance. The health and safety \nof our people is core to Philips purpose. Our culture of “Impact with care for patients, people, and \nthe planet” starts with taking care of ourselves and each other. Our purpose is to improve people’s \nhealth and well-being, and therefore, we value a safe work environment and the health and well-\nbeing of our employees. As we strive to look after the physical and mental health of our people, \nthe H&S Leadership team embarked on a learning journey for further improvement in 2024. The \nteam conducted a thorough review of internal and external H&S audit findings, conducted \ninterviews with a wide range of stakeholders in the company, carried out SWOT analysis, and \nreviewed and prioritized key focus areas. This information was used to develop a H&S strategic \nroadmap 2025-2030. In 2024, the following key strategic programs were identified to drive further execution to our \nvision:\n• Leadership-led safety culture to further drive accountability and ownership for people safety. • Standardization and simplification of Philips’ Corporate Safety Standards (PCSS) to allow for \nprioritized risk management and consistent implementation of H&S minimum requirements \nworldwide.

It is further supported by the \nPhilips Diversity & Inclusion Policy which is aimed to act on our commitment to an inclusive \nworkplace for our employees and other workers that reflects the diversity of our community.
