These are subdivided into \nthe following areas: labor standards, adequate wages, work-life bal-\nance, training and skill development, secure employment and social \ndialogue, employee privacy, and occupational safety and health. Labor standards \nContinental has defined an approach for the management of labor \nstandards for its own workforce that is intended to prevent and re-\nduce actual and potential negative impacts and risks as well as \nstrengthen positive impacts with regard to working time, discrimi-\nnation, forced labor and child labor as well as other human rights \nand working conditions. This is part of the “Responsible Value \nChain Due Diligence System” (RVCDDS). Continental is thus pursuing the ambition of creating good work-\ning conditions and a 100 % responsible value chain by 2050 at \nthe latest. As part of the RVCDDS, Continental has adopted so-\ncalled Responsible Value Chain Commitments (RVC commit-\nments), which include the following for the area of labor stand-\nards: no child labor, fair payment, equal treatment, no forced la-\nbor or modern slavery, freedom of association and working con-\nditions, including working time. With the specific RVC commitment for equal treatment, Continental \nstrives for a working environment that is free from discrimination, \nincluding harassment, in any form. This is an integral part of the \nmanagement system and is supported by dedicated diversity man-\nagement aimed at promoting equal opportunities and advancing \ndiversity and inclusion.'), Document(id='544084e6-0315-43c8-b6d7-5953ac9f4cb3', metadata={'source': '902', 'page': '192'}, page_content=' \n \n \nContinental AG   2024 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability Report – Social Information \n189\nMaterial Impacts, Risks and Opportunities Related to Workers in the Value Chain\nContinental assessed its potential and actual negative and positive \nimpacts as well as risks and opportunities related to sustainability \naccording to the regulatory requirements and as described in the \nGeneral disclosures (ESRS 2) section.

Labor standards \nContinental has defined an approach for the management of labor \nstandards for its own workforce that is intended to prevent and re-\nduce actual and potential negative impacts and risks as well as \nstrengthen positive impacts with regard to working time, discrimi-\nnation, forced labor and child labor as well as other human rights \nand working conditions. This is part of the “Responsible Value \nChain Due Diligence System” (RVCDDS). Continental is thus pursuing the ambition of creating good work-\ning conditions and a 100 % responsible value chain by 2050 at \nthe latest. As part of the RVCDDS, Continental has adopted so-\ncalled Responsible Value Chain Commitments (RVC commit-\nments), which include the following for the area of labor stand-\nards: no child labor, fair payment, equal treatment, no forced la-\nbor or modern slavery, freedom of association and working con-\nditions, including working time. With the specific RVC commitment for equal treatment, Continental \nstrives for a working environment that is free from discrimination, \nincluding harassment, in any form.

These are subdivided into \nthe following areas: labor standards, adequate wages, work-life bal-\nance, training and skill development, secure employment and social \ndialogue, employee privacy, and occupational safety and health. Labor standards \nContinental has defined an approach for the management of labor \nstandards for its own workforce that is intended to prevent and re-\nduce actual and potential negative impacts and risks as well as \nstrengthen positive impacts with regard to working time, discrimi-\nnation, forced labor and child labor as well as other human rights \nand working conditions. This is part of the “Responsible Value \nChain Due Diligence System” (RVCDDS). Continental is thus pursuing the ambition of creating good work-\ning conditions and a 100 % responsible value chain by 2050 at \nthe latest. As part of the RVCDDS, Continental has adopted so-\ncalled Responsible Value Chain Commitments (RVC commit-\nments), which include the following for the area of labor stand-\nards: no child labor, fair payment, equal treatment, no forced la-\nbor or modern slavery, freedom of association and working con-\nditions, including working time. With the specific RVC commitment for equal treatment, Continental \nstrives for a working environment that is free from discrimination, \nincluding harassment, in any form. This is an integral part of the \nmanagement system and is supported by dedicated diversity man-\nagement aimed at promoting equal opportunities and advancing \ndiversity and inclusion.'), Document(id='caea5e7c-d55e-40d5-adc2-1c8ce8cb7941', metadata={'source': '937', 'page': '200'}, page_content='› Substances of concern and very high concern with regard to po-\ntential impacts due to their use in own operations, the upstream \nvalue chain and the downstream value chain (see the Pollution \n(ESRS E2) section). › Labor standards with a more detailed description of the Respon-\nsible Value Chain Due Diligence System (RVCDDS) and the pro-\ncesses for own operations (see the Own workforce (ESRS S1) sec-\ntion).

The company \nalso endorses the Women’s Empowerment Principles established \nby the UN Global Compact and UN Women, demonstrating its dedi-\ncation to promoting diversity and inclusion across its operations. Monitoring of the adherence to these standards is anchored in the \nRVCDDS review process, including a revision of its rules and pro-\ncesses, if required. To incorporate stakeholder interests into the management system, \nContinental has established various formats. These include specific \nworkshops and conferences, which are defined as measures by the \nlabor standards rules. Another format is the regular Employee Sur-\nvey OUR BASICS Live in which Continental’s employees are asked \nabout different topics related to Continental’s values. The integra-\ntion of these interests into the system is carried out as part of the \nannual review process. To ensure a comprehensive understanding and engagement related \nto labor standards within the organization, Continental communi-\ncates the management approach through diverse channels.

With this management approach, Continental is pursuing the ambi-\ntion of creating a 100 % responsible value chain by 2050 at the lat-\nest. The “Responsible Value Chain Due Diligence System” (RVCDDS) \nimplemented for this purpose aims to protect both human and en-\nvironmental rights along the value chain. It formulates the “Respon-\nsible Value Chain Commitments” (RVC commitments) in the areas \nof labor standards, occupational safety and health, environment, se-\ncurity practices and land rights, which apply to Continental’s direct \nsuppliers. With the RVC commitments, the RVCDDS explicitly addresses re-\nspect for human rights, particularly with the RVC commitments in \nthe area of labor standards. The safety of workers, precarious working conditions, trafficking in \nhuman beings, forced labor (including debt bondage) and child la-\nbor are also addressed by Continental’s RVC commitments and \nBusiness Partner Code of Conduct.

Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for \nconsumers and end-users to raise concerns  \n \nGrievance channels for consumers and end-users \nContinental’s processes and channels to cooperate on remediation \nof negative impacts on consumers and end-users, and also to raise \nconcerns, are mainly the customer service centers of the group \nsectors and as well as Continental’s integrity hotline. The customer service centers are specific channels for consumers \nand end-users for any product-related issues. Furthermore, the in-\ntegrity hotline is an additional channel for integrity-related product \nissues. However, it is not intended as a channel to report discontent \nwith Continental’s products. The availability of Continental's integrity hotline is pointed out in \nContinental`s business relationships via our Business Partner Code \nof Conduct, which is also publicly available on our website. The tracking and monitoring of concerns raised through customer \nservice centers takes place directly in the customer service centers \nand through related processes. The tracking and monitoring of the \nintegrity-related product issues raised and dealt with was described \nin the process for tC case management which is part of the man-\nagement approach to technical and product compliance. Further \ninformation on how Continental ensures the effectiveness of the in-\ntegrity hotline can be found in the Business conduct and corporate \ngovernance (ESRS G1) section in this sustainability report.

Further information on protection of Continental’s integrity hotline \nusers from retaliation can be found in the information on Business \nconduct and corporate governance (ESRS G1) in this sustainability \nreport. Remediation processes \nContinental’s general approach to remedy in cases of material neg-\native impacts on consumers and/or end-users is in line with na-\ntional regulations. In case of individual negative product-related incidents, Continental \nfollows the regulations of the respective national authorities and ini-\ntiates, if required, e.g. recalls either on its own or indirectly via re-\ncalls by customers that place the final product on the market.""), Document(id='45a7450e-f8e0-4bce-afcc-c70b682fff5d', metadata={'source': '841', 'page': '181'}, page_content='Concerns or complaints \ncan be submitted via the channels provided for this purpose.

Key aspects regarding secure employment and social dialogue are \nregulated in particular by local laws, regulations and regulatory pro-\nvisions. By definition, social dialogue is an interest-based exchange with \nemployees and their representatives. In order to gain further in-\nsights and consider the interests of its own workforce in the man-\nagement approach, Continental uses its internal communication \nchannels and has integrated feedback processes into various en-\ngagement formats and training courses. An additional formalized \nprocess is the OUR BASICS Live employee survey, which gathers \nthe employee’s opinions and views on various topics related to \nContinental’s values. These are recorded, consolidated and ana-\nlyzed in an established process. Furthermore, co-determination \npractices such as employee representation on the Supervisory \nBoard and the involvement of the Group Works Council in relevant \ndecision-making processes directly incorporate the interests of em-\nployees and enable the alignment of management strategies with \ntheir needs.

The Sustainability Matters on the conditions of workers in the value \nchain and on forced labor in the value chain are material issues \nidentified in the Schneider Electric materiality analysis. The \nCompany has deployed a robust governance and supplier \nengagement framework to perform a risk analysis to screen and \nmitigate the risk of workers in upstream. The Company’s supply \nchain is exposed to varying levels of risks depending on the \nenvironmental, social, and ethical contexts of the countries in which \nthey operate. These country-related risks are one of the important \nfactors in customizing risk profile of suppliers. To evaluate and mitigate the sustainability risk from its global \nsuppliers, Schneider Electric conducts a risk evaluation of its entire \nsupply base on an annual basis. This evaluation covers \nsustainability risks and specific parameters such as the type of \nindustrial process used by the suppliers, their technology, and the \ngeographic location. This allows the Group to factor in risks that \nmay arise from a country’s specific situation (social, political, etc.). These parameters are compiled in a third-party independent \ndatabase (RBA methodology, ex-EICC, of which Schneider Electric \nhas been a member since January 2018). Schneider Electric’s \nentire Core network of about 50,000 tier 1 suppliers is processed \nthrough this methodology and is refreshed every year with the new \nsupplier baseline to identify high risk suppliers.

While countries have flexibility to define eligibility and policy \ndetails per statutory and/or market requirements, the policy \nestablishes a global minimum standard for paid leave. In 2023, the Group globally deployed the updated Global Family \nLeave Policy for all employees, where parental and care leave were \nincreased. Although the duration for bereavement leaves remained \nunchanged, the local adaptation was enhanced by adopting a \nflexible definition of “Immediate Family” in acknowledgment of the \ndiverse cultures and religions displayed by the global workforce.

Our commitments to our people are observed in \naccordance with our General Business Principles, Speak Up, Human Rights, Occupational Health & \nSafety, Fair Employment, and Diversity & Inclusion policies. We continued our Total Workforce Strategy, which considers all sources of skills, capabilities, \nlocations and changes in the labor market in order to deliver the Workforce of the Future. Globally, \nwe work with different worker types: employees and contingent workers, as well external services. In 2024, we further focused on the implementation of our external workforce strategy. In addition, \nwe have been looking at how we are attracting contingent workforce talent. Direct sourcing has \nbeen expanded to 26% in the Netherlands and to 40% in the US, and has been rolled out to India \n(11%). To strengthen the way we directly source contingent workforce talent, our own Philips \nemployer value proposition is utilized for the different functions to attract these contingent \nworkers. Total Workforce Strategy\nWe use our Right Shoring & Sourcing methodology to implement the Total Workforce Strategy. This methodology steers improvements in workforce composition towards the ‘right \nshore’ (onshore, nearshore and offshore) and the ‘right source’ (employees, contingent workers \nand external services). The program delivered EUR 7 million in savings in 2024. To develop the workforce that can deliver our strategy we have a Strategic Priorities recruitment \nteam who focus on the R&D, Patient Safety & Quality, Clinical and Informatics roles critical to our \nsuccess. Together, in 2024, they delivered 1,555 roles. In all of our external recruitment we secured \n38% candidates with Medical Technology expertise. Talent attraction\nIn 2024, we continued to recruit the talent we need to deliver our strategy, filling 11,391 positions \nacross the organization, of which 30% were internal hires. For external recruitment our strategic \nhiring channels of Direct Sourcing (headhunting) and Referrals delivered 33% of our new joiners to \nPhilips.

Our commitments to our people are observed in \naccordance with our General Business Principles, Speak Up, Human Rights, Occupational Health & \nSafety, Fair Employment, and Diversity & Inclusion policies. We continued our Total Workforce Strategy, which considers all sources of skills, capabilities, \nlocations and changes in the labor market in order to deliver the Workforce of the Future. Globally, \nwe work with different worker types: employees and contingent workers, as well external services. In 2024, we further focused on the implementation of our external workforce strategy. In addition, \nwe have been looking at how we are attracting contingent workforce talent. Direct sourcing has \nbeen expanded to 26% in the Netherlands and to 40% in the US, and has been rolled out to India \n(11%). To strengthen the way we directly source contingent workforce talent, our own Philips \nemployer value proposition is utilized for the different functions to attract these contingent \nworkers. Total Workforce Strategy\nWe use our Right Shoring & Sourcing methodology to implement the Total Workforce Strategy. This methodology steers improvements in workforce composition towards the ‘right \nshore’ (onshore, nearshore and offshore) and the ‘right source’ (employees, contingent workers \nand external services). The program delivered EUR 7 million in savings in 2024. To develop the workforce that can deliver our strategy we have a Strategic Priorities recruitment \nteam who focus on the R&D, Patient Safety & Quality, Clinical and Informatics roles critical to our \nsuccess. Together, in 2024, they delivered 1,555 roles. In all of our external recruitment we secured \n38% candidates with Medical Technology expertise. Talent attraction\nIn 2024, we continued to recruit the talent we need to deliver our strategy, filling 11,391 positions \nacross the organization, of which 30% were internal hires. For external recruitment our strategic \nhiring channels of Direct Sourcing (headhunting) and Referrals delivered 33% of our new joiners to \nPhilips.

In 2024, we continued to develop our due diligence strategy by conducting Human Rights Impact \nAssessments (HRIAs). Philips conducted HRIAs at its sites in China and Indonesia, living up to its \ncommitment of conducting regular HRIAs at 100% of its at-risk sites. Philips intends to monitor the \nprogress and findings from at-risk sites and take them on a continuous improvement journey \nregarding human rights topics. Although the HRIA of selected sites is primarily focused on Philips' own operations, a derived deep-\ndive approach for certain suppliers has been established since 2022. For five suppliers, a focused \nassessment on human rights was conducted in 2024; this is distinct from the broader supplier \nsustainability assessment approach, which covers sustainability more holistically as indicated in \nSupplier sustainability & Workers in the value chain.

program. Philips SpeakUp program, and its underlying \npolicies and procedures, aligns with relevant legislation on whistleblowing (including but not \nlimited to Directive (EU) 2019/1937) to ensure reporters are protected from (attempted) retaliation. SpeakUp ensures standardized reporting and enables employees and third parties to escalate \nconcerns 24/7. Concerns raised through this SpeakUp program are registered consistently in a \nsingle database hosted outside of Philips servers to ensure confidentiality and security of identity \nand information. Further details on how Philips ensures the protection of reporters of potential GBP \nviolations, and ensures an independent and impartial review of concerns, can be found in the \nPhilips SpeakUp Policy. Encouraging people to speak up through the available channels if they have \na concern will continue to be a cornerstone of our GBP training, communications and awareness \ncampaigns. GBP compliance officers and SpeakUp investigators receive training on following up on SpeakUp \nconcerns in line with Philips SpeakUp Policy and investigation guidelines. Specifically in 2024, we \nagain focused on increasing awareness about integrity and on emphasizing the importance of \nspeaking up.

The results showed 79% of the respondents feel comfortable addressing concerns related \nto the GBP. The next Business Integrity Survey will be deployed in 2025, along with an updated \nGBP e-learning.
