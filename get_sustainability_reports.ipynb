      "\n",
      "This year was important for sustainability across our global\n",
      "network. We have redesigned our business to become a pureplay strategic partner to the healthcare industry, with a focus\n",
      "on the pharma, biotech and nutrition markets. This new focus\n",
      "has provided us with an opportunity to realign our strategy\n",
      "and ensure we are set to deliver sustainable value creation in\n",
      "\n",
      "the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within our newly focused structure, we have defined and\n",
      "communicated our long-term strategic priorities. Sustainability\n",
      "is a critical component of this strategic framework, sitting in\n",
      "the center of a wider “Five-S” Model that also includes scope,\n",
      "scale, solutions and speed. To support this commitment, we\n",
      "have formed a global Sustainability and Risk Committee, which\n",
      "defines our sustainability strategy and delivery mechanisms, as\n",
      "well as ensuring that relevant topics are communicated and\n",

      "Development Goals to deliver on global challenges. These\n",
      "include: good health and wellbeing; climate action; gender\n",
      "equality; industry, innovation and infrastructure; responsible\n",
      "consumption and production; clean water and sanitation; and\n",
      "quality education. More widely, we also remain committed to\n",
      "upholding the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, which\n",
      "we use as a compass to balance our sustainability strategies,\n",
      "policies and activities with stakeholders and societal needs.\n",

      "Our environmental impact has been recalculated to reflect\n",
      "our new footprint, which is now smaller since the divestment\n",
      "of our former Specialty Ingredients business. Completing this\n",
      "divestment in 2021 also provided the opportunity for us to\n",
      "address legacy issues arising from Lonza’s past.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Visp (CH) region, we have been working closely with the\n",
      "authorities to deploy a lasting solution to the issues caused by\n",

      "we have made a provision of CHF 285 million for the first phase\n",
      "of the remediation project, which will take a decade to complete\n",
      "and will commence within the next two years. We have worked\n",
      "with our environmental experts to establish a provision to cover\n",

      "(FOEN) to plan and construct a catalytic converter to remove\n",
      "nitrous oxide emissions arising from the production of niacin.\n",
      "In doing this, we ensured that the divestment was completed\n",
      "responsibly, by providing a solution which was already on track\n",
      "to be resolved by the time of the sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Lonza, the safety of our employees is a top priority for us and\n",

      "of customers, such as AstraZeneca, Capricor Therapeutics and\n",
      "Humanigen, as well as expanding our existing collaboration\n",
      "with Moderna on Spikevax, the COVID-19 vaccine.\n",

Local management is responsible for maintaining good labor relations according to legal requirements and agreements with unions, work councils and other employee representing bodies. We respect these relationships and work with these parties in a mutually respectful manner. In addition to the country-specific employee representation, we have also established a European Work Council that holds regular meetings. This is designed to maintain a positive culture of information and communication.

We have redesigned our business to become a pureplay strategic partner to the healthcare industry, with a focus\\non the pharma, biotech and nutrition markets. This new focus\\nhas provided us with an opportunity to realign our strategy\\nand ensure we are set to deliver sustainable value creation in\\n\\nthe long run.\\n\\nWithin our newly focused structure, we have defined and\\ncommunicated our long-term strategic priorities. Sustainability\\nis a critical component of this strategic framework, sitting in\\nthe center of a wider “Five-S” Model that also includes scope,\\nscale, solutions and speed. To support this commitment, we\\nhave formed a global Sustainability and Risk Committee, which\\ndefines our sustainability strategy and delivery mechanisms, as\\nwell as ensuring that relevant topics are communicated and\\ndiscussed with stakeholders and the group leadership.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\nWe have structured our efforts around seven of the UN Sustainable\\n\\nDevelopment Goals to deliver on global challenges. These\\ninclude: good health and wellbeing; climate action; gender\\nequality; industry, innovation and infrastructure; responsible\\nconsumption and production; clean water and sanitation; and\\nquality education. More widely, we also remain committed to\\nupholding the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, which\\nwe use as a compass to balance our sustainability strategies,\\npolicies and activities with stakeholders and societal needs.\\n\\nOur environmental impact has been recalculated to reflect\\nour new footprint, which is now smaller since the divestment\\nof our former Specialty Ingredients business. Completing this\\ndivestment in 2021 also provided the opportunity for us to\\naddress legacy issues arising from Lonza’s past.\\n\\nIn the Visp (CH) region, we have been working closely with the\\nauthorities to deploy a lasting solution to the issues caused by\\nthe old Gamsenried landfill. In line with reporting requirements,\\nwe have made a provision of CHF 285 million for the first phase\\nof the remediation project, which will take a decade to complete\\nand will commence within the next two years. We have worked\\nwith our environmental experts to establish a provision to cover\\nthe majority of the remediation costs. By addressing legacy\\nissues, we are now more strongly positioned to deliver a step\\nchange in our environmental performance.\\n\\nPrior to the Specialty Ingredients business divestment we\\nworked with the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment\\n\\n(FOEN) to plan and construct a catalytic converter to remove\\nnitrous oxide emissions arising from the production of niacin.\\nIn doing this, we ensured that the divestment was completed\\nresponsibly, by providing a solution which was already on track\\nto be resolved by the time of the sale.\\n\\nAt Lonza, the safety of our employees is a top priority for us and\\nwe are pleased to confirm that in 2021 we made around 32,200\\nsafety improvements across our global site network based on\\nobservations and recommendations of our workforce. We are\\n\\npleased to continue the good performance from the prior year\\nregarding lost-time injuries.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWe have also continued to focus on maintaining business\\ncontinuity through the pandemic. We have delivered to our\\ncustomers without interruption, despite global uncertainties\\nand ongoing supply chain challenges. Specifically, we have\\nworked on a series of COVID-19 related programs for a number\\nof customers, such as AstraZeneca, Capricor Therapeutics and\\nHumanigen, as well as expanding our existing collaboration\\nwith Moderna on Spikevax, the COVID-19 vaccine.\\n\\nOur focus on delivering for our customers was cited alongside\\nother factors in the positive response to our 2021 customer\\nengagement survey. Inevitably there is work to do to maintain\\nand improve current satisfaction levels, but we are pleased\\nto see widespread endorsement of our efforts to navigate\\nthe pandemic and maintain business continuity.\\n\\nFinally, in 2021 we were recognized as one of the World’s\\nMost Ethical Companies 2021 by the Ethisphere Institute,\\na global leader in defining and advancing the standards of\\nethical business practices. This recognition is based on a\\ncomprehensive and robust review of a company’s governance,\\nleadership and reputation, environmental and societal impact,\\nethics and compliance program and overall commitment to\\na culture of ethics.\\n\\nLooking to 2022, we are focused on building on the positive\\nmomentum we have generated around sustainability. We\\nhave built ESG metrics into our company performance\\nmeasurements and our reward and recognition allocations\\nfor the global employee community, commencing in 2022.\\nWe trust this will further unite and galvanize our employee\\ncommunity around long-term value creation, and ensure that\\nwe continue to fulfil our purpose of enabling a healthier world.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n**Pierre-Alain Ruffieux**\\n\\nChief Executive Officer (CEO)\\n\\n\\n**Our Commitment**\\n\\nNorway 5\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\n**About Us**\\n\\nFounded in Switzerland 125 years ago in 1897, we are one of\\nthe world’s leading and most trusted strategic partners to the\\nhealthcare industry. We work to enable a healthier world by\\nsupporting our customers in the pharma, biotech and nutrition\\nmarkets to deliver new and innovative medicines that help treat a\\nwide range of diseases. Our structure of four divisions has been\\ndesigned to capture synergies and meet our customers’ needs.\\n\\nMore information on our business and markets is provided in\\n[the Our Businesses section of our Annual Report.](https://lonza.com/annualreport/2021/our-businesses/innovations-in-2021)\\n\\n**Economic Performance**\\n\\nWe strive to create value for our shareholders, customers,\\nemployees, suppliers and communities. We distribute our\\nderived economic value to various stakeholders through a variety\\nof streams. This includes employees through compensation\\nand benefits, shareholders through share price appreciation,\\nsuppliers and service providers through raw material and service\\ncontracts and society and governments through taxes and local\\ncommunity projects. Part of the earned value is retained in\\n\\n\\n\\nthe company for further growth through innovation, strategic\\ninvestments and bolt-on acquisitions. For further information,\\n[please see the Financial Statements section of our Annual Report.](https://lonza.com/annualreport/2021/financials)\\n\\nWe continue to focus on our growth trajectory by making\\ntargeted investments, while optimizing our business and\\nproduct portfolios. In 2022, we will prioritize the following key\\ninternal initiatives:\\n\\n- \\x07Full integration of material environmental, social and governance\\n\\n(ESG) measures, and alignment of our ESG ambitions with\\nLonza’s compensation systems;\\n\\n- \\x07Focus on safety and health of our employees, and business\\n\\ncontinuity through the pandemic;\\n\\n- \\x07Continued levels of capital expenditure (CAPEX) investment\\n\\nto meet customer demand and deliver sustained growth;\\n\\n- \\x07Focus on talent attraction and development to support\\n\\nexpansions and new programs;\\n\\n- \\x07Establish and strengthen systems and processes across our\\n\\ndivisions, to optimize efficiency and delivery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Governance**\\n\\nIn accordance with the law and the Lonza Articles of Association,\\nthe Board of Directors is the most senior management body of\\nthe Lonza Group.

As we continue to expand in response to escalating\\ncustomer demand, we are proportionately growing our employee\\npopulation. Our colleague community grew by more than 15%\\nin 2021. The majority of these new joiners have come into key\\nsites in Visp (CH), Portsmouth (US) and Houston (US), focused\\non strategic growth projects. This growth has brought the need\\nto consider talent from other industries requiring similar skill\\nsets, including fast-moving consumer goods and consumer\\ncompanies. We had to broaden our search for talent across\\nEuropean countries to find critical skill sets, and to make one\\nof our major sites, Visp (CH), a place for international talent. As\\nwe welcomed employees from other industries and countries,\\nwe have provided new employees with onboarding and training\\nopportunities to support their success from the outset. Our\\ncore organizational values (initiative, innovation, inclusion and\\nintegrity), are also integrated into our training and development\\nplans for all employees.\\n\\n\\n2020: 35%\\n\\nVoluntary and involuntary turnover is analyzed and monitored\\nregularly at a site, division, function and global level to support\\ntalent attraction and retention. Like many other companies, we\\nhave seen an increase in turnover in 2021 to 12.7% (including\\nvoluntary and involuntary cases). This was largely a knock-on\\neffect from the more limited job market movements in the\\nprevious year, during the height of the pandemic.

Our ERM program enables us to identify the\\nmost significant risks to our organization that impact value to\\nour stakeholders, along with mitigation actions and owners to\\nminimize the probability and/or impact of risks.\\n\\nThe findings of the annual bottom-up enterprise risk identification\\nand assessment process, the year-on-year changes in risk\\ncategories, and updates on mitigation actions are included in\\nthe information presented to and discussed annually with the\\nExecutive Committee and the Board of Directors. Some of the\\n\\ntrends influencing the industry are viewed as opportunities\\nrather than risks for companies in the healthcare industry\\nsuch as ourselves. An increasing focus on ESG topics, as well\\nas trends such as aging societies, growing populations and\\nthe increasing need for safe and abundant food are directly\\nconsidered in our enterprise risk assessment and shape our\\nglobal strategy. Alongside this, we also include climate, natural\\nand environmental risks into our assessment.\\n\\n[For more information about ERM, see the Financial Statements](https://lonza.com/annualreport/2021/financials)\\nsection of our Annual Report.\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n**Business during COVID-19**\\nLonza has played a critical role in the response to the ongoing\\nCOVID-19 pandemic as a manufacturer of various treatments, from\\nmRNA vaccine drug substance to anti-viral drug components.\\nWe managed challenges as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved\\nthroughout 2021 and played an active role in helping to control\\nthe pandemic. In 2020, we established both global and regional\\ncross-functional taskforces to manage every aspect of the\\npandemic development; the taskforces have continued to\\nmanage their responsibilities throughout 2021.\\n\\n**Vaccine Manufacturing and Other COVID-19 Related**\\n**Projects**\\nWe have continued to develop and manufacture many potentially\\nlife-saving treatments this year, by establishing new partnerships\\nand expanding existing collaborations to manufacture COVID-19\\ntherapies for our customers.\\n\\nWe have expanded our collaboration with Moderna to produce\\ndrug substance for its Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine. The extended\\nagreement included doubling production capacity at our site\\nin Visp (CH) to a total of six production lines and installing a\\nnew drug substance production line at our site in Geleen (NL).\\n\\nIn addition to our work with Moderna, we have been working\\non COVID-19 projects with other customers, including:\\n\\n- \\x07AstraZeneca’s AZD7442, a combination of two long-acting\\n\\nantibodies;\\n\\n- \\x07Capricor’s CAP-1002, a cell therapy candidate for the treatment\\n\\nof Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and complications\\narising from COVID-19;\\n\\n- \\x07Humanigen’s Lenzilumab COVID-19 therapy.\\n\\n**Supporting our Employee Community**\\nSince the outbreak of the pandemic, the health and safety of\\nour employee community was a top priority. We have taken\\nsteps to ensure that employees feel supported as our working\\npractices continue to adapt to the conditions required by the\\npandemic.\\n\\nA dedicated wellbeing program focused on mental and personal\\nhealth has provided employees with access to support, across\\nissues including digital wellbeing and the impact of COVID19 on children and childcare. The global program has been\\ncomplemented by local wellbeing initiatives at sites including\\nthe People Care Center in Visp (CH), Mental Health Ambassadors\\nnetwork in Slough (UK) and volunteering hours at sites in the US.\\n\\n**Encouraging Vaccination**\\nWe have taken an active role in encouraging our employee\\ncommunity to be vaccinated to protect both the health of\\nindividual employees and the broader population of the\\ncommunities in which we operate.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nAt our site in Visp (CH), an important global vaccine substance\\nproduction center, we set up a vaccination center with the\\nsupport of local health authorities to offer eligible employees\\nand their families the opportunity to be vaccinated on site. The\\ninitiative served to relieve pressure on the local vaccination\\ncenter and supported the community by accelerating the pace\\nof vaccinations in the region.\\n\\n**Cybersecurity**\\nThe security of information and data is a priority for our business.\\nIt enables us to ensure the constant availability of our critical\\nsystems and to protect our information, including the information\\nthat is entrusted to us by our customers and partners.\\n\\nThe Lonza IT Security Department is responsible for ensuring\\nthat appropriate technical, procedural and organizational\\nsafeguards are in place for our information systems, including\\ntesting for potential security weaknesses. The Department is\\nalso responsible for providing training to our employees and\\ncontingency workers on how they contribute to the security\\nof our information assets. The IT Security team’s activities in\\n2021 included:\\n\\n\\n**Responsibility**\\n\\n- \\x07Continued expansion and enhancement of governance and\\n\\npolicy, based on international standards;\\n\\n- \\x07Implementing a robust, user friendly and scalable security\\n\\narchitecture including solutions and services;\\n\\n- \\x07Optimizing the security operations service, rapid response\\n\\nand risk awareness;\\n\\n- \\x07Minimizing possible business disruption and empowering\\n\\nassociates to work securely and effectively in an international\\ncollaborative environment.\\n\\nThe strategy of Lonza IT Security includes implementing holistic,\\npreventive, detective and reactive IT security measures, in line\\nwith the relevant risk levels. It also provides risk assessments,\\ncontributes to enterprise risk management and defines security\\nand IT control requirements for projects and risk remediation\\nmeasures. Finally, it aims to ensure that we meet applicable laws\\nand regulations in collaboration with Legal, Quality Assurance\\nand other departments.\\n\\nWe run ongoing training and awareness initiatives on the\\nsubject of information security. Recent surveys indicate that\\nwell over 95% of our associates are aware of their critical role\\n\\nin protecting our information. New technologies and methods\\nare being used to ensure this awareness remains high, without\\nreducing the impact of the message.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\nAt the time of writing, Lonza Group has a Secure Scorecard [©]\\nrating of A/95 and the Bitscore [©] rating as Advanced/740 [1] . This\\nis above average for the industry and has been for more than a\\nyear. These ratings are provided by independent organizations\\nbased on a technical analysis of our assets and provide a snapshot\\nof cybersecurity risk.\\n\\n**Data Protection**\\n\\nWe take data protection seriously around the globe. Our guiding\\nprinciple is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in\\naddition to any national law of those countries in which we\\noperate. Moreover, every employee commits to follow our Internal\\nData Protection Guidelines. The content of these Guidelines is\\n\\nalso included in the annual Code of Conduct training which all\\nemployees are required to complete.\\n\\nThe protection of our employee and our customer personal\\ndata is critical to maintaining trust with our stakeholders. It has\\nlong been a focus for the Privacy Taskforce, meeting monthly\\nto address any concerns, and developing issues. Taskforce\\nmembers include our Data Protection Officer and dedicated\\n\\nmembers from across our divisions, sites and functions, including\\ncolleagues from the Legal, IT and Marketing Departments.\\n\\nOur website Privacy and Cookies Policies are updated to provide\\nour customers and website visitors with maximum choice and\\n\\nsafety.\\n\\n**Compliance**\\nWe are committed to regulatory compliance and ethical behavior\\nacross all areas of our businesses and operations. Our industry is\\nhighly regulated, which implies that we are inspected by various\\nregulatory authorities, certification bodies and customers\\nregularly. Any findings during these inspections are addressed\\nand used to support the continuous improvement process.\\n\\nIn 2021 our sites underwent 33 regulatory inspections. In line with\\nthe increase of the commercial and development production,\\nand a growing portfolio, the number of customer audits (on-site\\nplus remote audits) also continues to increase. The successful\\ninspections and audits are a valuable feedback loop to assure\\ncompliance across the company.\\n\\n1 \\x07Bitsight uses a credit rating style measurement to communicate IT Security Risk.\\n\\nBitSight Security Ratings are calculated on a scale of 250-900 with a higher rating\\nindicating better security performance. Secure Scorecard uses a combination of data\\npoints and then applies proprietary algorithms to articulate an organization’s security\\neffectiveness into a quantifiable A-F score.\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\nEnvironmental compliance is also critical to our operations.\\nLonza sites employ a management system approach, which\\nincludes regular information updates on legal changes and a\\ncompliance assurance mechanism with internal and external\\ncontrols. Various sites have implemented a certified ISO 14001\\nsystem, which includes oversight of regulatory requirements.\\nAdditionally, we received assurance by a Swiss certification\\nbody that Lonza’s Corporate EHS management system is fully\\naligned with ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 standard requirements.\\n\\nIn 2021, we recorded ten environmental incidents across our\\nnetwork, largely through wastewater permit exceedances and\\nour incident-rate (per 200,000 worked hours) decreased to 0.05\\n(from 0.10 in 2020). Our rate of process safety incidents (number\\nof events, fines and penalties) with eight incidents decreased to\\n0.06 (from 0.08 in 2020). Most of these incidents were related\\nto contained spills. These rates refer to all Lonza sites, including\\nthe Specialty Ingredients business until end of June 2021.\\n\\nRegular internal audits of different functions (e.g. EHS audit,\\nloss prevention visits, quality audit) provide both oversight and\\ngovernance. EHS audits of our sites are performed every three\\nyears, findings reported to the senior management team and\\nagreed action items followed up to closure. In management\\nreviews with their teams, site managers verify compliance and\\nresults from regulatory inspections. Negative findings of this\\nreview are reported to our Ethics and Compliance Group. Fines,\\nif any, are an indication of non-compliance and are reported\\ninto the environmental data system and reviewed to identify\\n\\nthe root causes.\\n\\nFinally, through the Lonza Ethics Hotline, every employee can\\nraise concerns about non-compliance with internal and external\\nrules, and environmental concerns.\\n\\n**Product Compliance**\\nAll our products require a high and often regulated manufacturing\\npractice to assure required standards of quality and efficacy.\\nThey must be evaluated, manufactured, labeled and used\\nappropriately, to exclude health and safety risks for customers\\n\\nand end-consumers.\\n\\nMoreover, we must take into account public perceptions,\\nregulation and global chemical management initiatives such as\\nGHS (Globally Harmonized System for classification, labelling\\nand packaging of chemicals).\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nWe are predominantly involved in business-to-business\\ntransactions. We work to ensure that our products can safely\\nbe used by customers for their intended purpose. Our customers\\ngenerally have their own procedures and specialists to assess\\nhazards and risks, and we aim to provide the foundation and\\nnecessary data to support the safe use of our customers’ products.\\n\\nProduct health and safety profiles are evaluated through\\nsystematic processes and procedures that are embedded in\\nour organizational and business structure. We have experts\\nin regulatory compliance and registration, dangerous goods\\nand product classifications, toxicology, risk assessment and\\nproduct stewardship, covering the regions and markets in\\nwhich we operate. Potential hazards and risks associated with\\ntheir intended use are clearly communicated to our customers\\nvia product labels, Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and technical\\ncommunications.\\n\\nOur processes in assessing and improving the health and safety\\nimpacts of our products, continue to remain a focus for growth\\nand investment as we integrate newly acquired products and\\nbusinesses into our product stewardship and management\\n\\nstructures.\\n\\nOur product formulation expertise, product-regulatory assurance\\nand global regulatory support provide distinct competitive\\nadvantages in a world of increasing chemicals registration,\\nlabeling and packaging requirements. We have a team of more\\nthan 60 regulatory experts in Europe, the Americas and Asia\\nPacific who serve and support our business globally.\\n\\nChallenging programs include the European Registration,\\nEvaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)\\ninitiative, the US EPA Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and\\nCalifornia Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act\\n(Proposition 65). In addition, other countries are launching\\nsimilar regulatory schemes (e.g. China-REACH, Korea K-REACH\\nand K-BPR, Turkey KKDIK). These are ongoing efforts and we\\ncontinue to strive to comply with the requirements, including\\nthose related to REACH Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC).\\n\\nThe health and safety of our employees will always remain a\\ntop priority. During 2021, 800 substances were assessed or\\nreassessed for their safe handling limits in relation to the risk\\nof exposure to chemicals in the work environment.\\n\\n**Animal Testing**\\nTo ensure the safe handling and use of products, regulatory\\nauthorities in many countries require animal testing, especially\\nin the development of health ingredients. When this is the\\ncase, we work with independent contract laboratories who are\\ncarefully selected to ensure they meet the highest ethical and\\nquality standards. Whenever possible, we request validated\\nalternatives to animal tests. We work with contract laboratories\\n\\nthat are accredited for animal welfare protection, plus all the\\nstudy protocols are approved by the institutional ethics board\\nand the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\\n\\n\\n**Responsibility**\\n\\nWe have also developed alternatives to animal models. Examples\\ninclude the Bioscience Solutions’ primary cell and media product\\nlines, which provide a viable alternative to animal models in\\nresearch and development labs.\\n\\nAn example where we work with animals is with horseshoe crabs.\\nThe blood of the North American Horseshoe Crab (Limulus\\npolyphemus) is the only known natural source that can be\\nprocessed into a component of the LAL (Limulus Amebocyte\\nLysate) Assay. Such assays are used in Quality Control (QC) tests\\nwhich ensure that injected pharmaceuticals and implanted\\nmedical devices are free from endotoxins and thus safe for\\n\\npatient use.\\n\\nBlood is collected from each crab in a similar way to human\\nblood donation and Lonza is committed to obtain and handle\\n\\nhorseshoe crabs using best practices in animal protection. We\\nensure the wellbeing of the crabs at every stage of the process.\\nThe crabs are collected beginning the second week of June,\\nafter the major spawning period in May, and one to three miles\\noffshore to ensure that any remaining spawning activity is not\\ninterrupted. They are also marked in a harmless way to ensure\\nno crab is bled twice in the same season and are safely returned\\nto the waters from which they were taken, usually within 24\\nhours of their original collection.\\n\\nWe support conservation and educational programs that help\\ncoastal communities protect horseshoe crab breeding and\\nnursery grounds, which include initiatives that seek to eliminate\\nthe use of crab species as bait in conch and eel fishing, and\\nimplement alternative solutions.\\n\\nAt the same time, we introduced an alternative approach: in\\n2003 we launched the first animal-free endotoxin detection\\n\\nmethod, PyroGene [®] rFC Assay, which relies on a man-made\\nrecombinant form to deliver an equivalent and reliable endotoxin\\ndetection method. Worldwide, there is a growing appeal in the\\npharmaceutical industry to consider recombinant technologies\\nthat can help alleviate, and eventually replace, the need for\\nanimal resources for endotoxin testing purposes.\\n\\nWe pursue a dual path in which we maximize our efforts to ensure\\nthat our work with horseshoe crabs has only a minimal impact\\non the animal and we simultaneously drive the introduction\\nof alternatives. This way, we strive to find the best possible\\nbalance between preserving nature and helping our customers\\nto deliver safe products.\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\n**Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption**\\n\\nConducting business in an ethical and compliant manner is at\\nthe forefront of all Lonza interactions. We take a zero-tolerance\\n\\napproach to bribery and corruption and we are committed to\\nacting professionally, fairly and with integrity at all times. Lonza\\nexpects all employees to perform with integrity every day\\nacross all divisions and locations. To reinforce this expectation,\\nall employees, regardless of job responsibility or location are\\nrequired to complete Lonza’s annual Code of Conduct training\\nwith a specific focus on recognizing, avoiding and reporting\\nany actual or suspected corruption activities. New employees\\nreceive an introduction on anti-corruption and anti-bribery via\\nan online training module. In addition, all Lonza employees with\\ncomputer access are provided specific Anti-Bribery and AntiCorruption training on a recurring basis. On a more granular\\nlevel, employees with job responsibilities or locations with\\nhigher risk are provided with live training on corruption and\\nbribery, and given guidance on how to raise issues for review.\\nThe Board and Executive Committee also receive this training\\nin addition to other regular training programs.\\n\\nTo supplement our training programs, we frequently communicate\\nkey elements of our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy.\\nShort videos, infographics and actual stories of misconduct\\nare provided to all employees as a reinforcement of Lonza’s\\nexpectations for compliance. All employees have access to\\nour Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy via our intranet.\\n\\nIn addition, suppliers that enter into our standard supply\\nagreement commit to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which\\nsets out commitments to working against corruption and\\nbribery. The Supplier Code of Conduct applies to our suppliers\\nas well as to any subcontractors or third parties that a supplier\\nmay engage in the performance of its contractual obligations.\\nCurrently, suppliers are required to implement internal measuring\\nprocedures, tools and indicators to guarantee compliance with\\nthe Supplier Code of Conduct principles and are encouraged to\\n[report any violations via e-mail or via the Lonza Ethics Hotline.](http://www.lonzaethicshotline.com/)\\n\\nOur Ethics & Compliance Group is charged with monitoring and\\npromoting compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption\\nlaws. In addition, we operate an automated interface for third\\nparty due diligence checks and monitoring.\\n\\n**Lonza Ethics Hotline**\\n\\nThe Lonza Ethics Hotline provides a mechanism for employees\\nand stakeholders to report potential violations of the Code of\\nConduct, our policies and procedures (including those related\\nto anti-corruption), or applicable laws and regulations. Such\\nreports may be made anonymously where permitted by law.\\nThose found responsible for any violations may face disciplinary\\naction (which may include termination of employment).\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\nThe Ethics & Compliance Group regularly conducts assessments\\nof hotline submissions for trending and benchmark purposes.\\nData generated from these assessments is used to guide training\\nand communications around geographies or business units as\\nwell as to measure the effectiveness of existing training, policies\\nor procedures. Review of hotline data has shown consistent\\nutilization, although we observed fluctuations in reporting\\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is similar to what has\\nbeen observed by our peers. We did note a wide range of case\\nsubmissions indicating an awareness and comfort in speaking\\nup across all aspects of our business.\\n\\nInternal submissions are also used for benchmark purposes\\nagainst other companies similar in size, industry, revenue and/\\nor geographic location. Multiple data points (e.g. submission\\ntype, disclosure of the reporter, source of the report, etc.) are\\nconsistently reviewed as a measure of hotline and investigation\\neffectiveness. We met or exceeded benchmark standards in\\n\\nmultiple categories, which further highlighted the effectiveness\\nof Lonza’s Speak Up Program and communications. Areas that\\nwere at benchmark or below were addressed via targeted and\\nspecific training and communications programs.\\n\\n**World’s Most Ethical Companies Award**\\nWe have been recognized as one of\\nthe World’s Most Ethical Companies\\n2021 by the Ethisphere Institute,\\na global leader in defining and\\nadvancing the standards of ethical\\nbusiness practices. This recognition\\nis based on a comprehensive and\\nrobust review of a company’s governance, leadership and\\nreputation, environmental and societal impact, ethics and\\ncompliance program and overall commitment to a culture of\\nethics. Structured by Ethisphere’s proprietary Ethics Quotient [®],\\nthe assessment process includes more than 200 data points,\\nwhich serves as an operating framework to capture and codify\\nthe leading practices of organizations across industries and\\n\\naround the world.\\n\\nThe list distinguishes companies that influence the business\\ncommunity and societies around the world in order to drive\\npositive change. It also highlights companies working with\\npartners and clients doing the right thing, by operating with\\nintegrity every day.\\n\\nBeing designated as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies\\nrecognizes our high standards of corporate integrity and\\nrespect towards its customers, suppliers, business partners\\nand other stakeholders. Lonza is one of just two companies\\nheadquartered in Switzerland to be included in the 2021 ranking.\\nIt is also one of only two companies to be named within the\\npharmaceuticals category of the Ethisphere [®] Institute ranking.\\nAccording to Ethisphere’s Ethics Index, the 2021 World’s Most\\nEthical Companies outperformed a comparable index by 7.1\\npercentage points from January 2016 to January 2021.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Responsibility**\\n\\nFresh water spring, Selfoss, South Iceland 23\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\n**Operations Assessed for Risks Related to Corruption**\\nWe conduct periodic risk assessments to identify business areas\\nand geographies for corruption and bribery risk. Taking into\\nconsideration Lonza’s material topics (as a result of our 2021\\nmateriality assessment), risks are categorized by likelihood as\\nwell as impact in relation to existing operations, future planned\\noperations, suppliers and other interactions. This is completed\\norganically as well as with assistance and guidance from external\\nexperts. Where higher risks are identified, mitigation plans are\\ndeveloped and mitigation steps are implemented, as required.\\nA global risk assessment was completed in 2018, which focused\\non antitrust, trade and anti-corruption.\\n\\n**Supply Chain Responsibility**\\n\\nDrawing on a broad global base, the Procurement teams play\\na vital role in reliably providing the right raw materials and\\nindirect goods and services to our manufacturing, research\\nand development sites worldwide.\\n\\nTogether with stakeholders from the different divisions and\\nfunctions, the Procurement teams develop solid approaches\\nfor spend categories across a diverse range of strategic raw\\nmaterials and services. The team also improves data quality,\\nanalytics and dashboards to track and communicate performance\\nand progress.\\n\\nAs an element of our supply chain responsibility, we also aim to\\nunderstand and assure the ESG performance of our suppliers by\\nexpanding our third party supplier due diligence process. With\\nmany legislations defining supply chain rules based on human\\nrights or environmental requirements, managing the supply\\nchain has become a pre-requisite of transparent reporting and\\ncompliance. This includes targeting a reduction of GHG emissions\\nacross the supply chain (known as Scope 3 GHG emissions) by\\ncollaborating with our top suppliers. This enhancement will be\\nalso linked to the incentive compensation framework.\\n\\nSDG 12 \\x07 **Responsible Consumption**\\n\\n**and Production**\\n\\n*“ \\x07It takes a network of suppliers and partners*\\n\\n*to enable a healthier world and it takes*\\n\\n*collaboration of that same network to*\\n\\n*reduce the collective carbon footprint*\\n*across the supply chain.”*\\n*Claude Dartiguelongue,*\\n*President, Capsules &*\\n*Health Ingredients (CHI)*\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\n**Ensuring Seamless Supplies**\\nThe Procurement teams faced various challenges in 2021. The\\nstrong global demand, combined with reduced labor availability\\nand a shortage of shipping containers, generated shortages of\\nmany basic raw materials (e.g. oil, wood, basic chemicals, etc.).\\nIn turn, these led to price increases. Manufacturers continue to\\nface delayed supplier deliveries and supply shortages, alongside\\nlabor shortages in many countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nWe were able to respond to these challenges appropriately and\\neffectively. In addition, the team navigated several unexpected\\nforce majeure events affecting major suppliers. Those events and\\nrelated geopolitical challenges encouraged us to strengthen our\\nrisk management, mitigation processes and tools. An end-to-end\\nrisk management process has been developed and rolled out\\nto automatically assess risks to Lonza’s raw materials against a\\nfive-gate risk register. This process allows the identification of\\nall high risk items from a business continuity perspective and\\nthe development of appropriate mitigation plans as required.\\n\\n**Value Chain and Supply**\\nThe breadth and diversity of our business means that the supply\\nchain includes approximately 23,000 suppliers. Roughly 3,000\\nare direct material suppliers ranging across basic chemicals\\nand naturally derived materials such as gelatin, to high-end\\nsystems and consumables for biopharmaceuticals or specialized\\ncomponents for cell and gene therapy production. Eighty percent\\nof spend originates from European or North American supply\\nlocations, with the remainder from other locations across the\\nworld. Half of our third party spend is on indirect goods and\\nservices (including energy, logistics and equipment).\\n\\nIn order to cope with this complexity, our Procurement teams\\ninclude category managers and site-based buyers, all focusing on\\nprocurement excellence. They develop and implement category\\nstrategies and manage the selection of suppliers and negotiation\\nof terms. They also reduce exposure to supply risks and scout,\\nevaluate and drive technical innovation and digital solutions. All\\nthese activities are designed to continuously improve internal\\nefficiency and enhance customer experience.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability in Procurement**\\nThrough stakeholder engagement, we identified gaps, future\\ntrends and requirements regarding sustainable sourcing and\\nsupplier risk assessment. The resulting procurement processes\\ninclude:\\n\\n- \\x07Enhanced approaches for sustainable procurement, increasing\\n\\nthe number of assessments and audits of our strategic\\nsuppliers;\\n\\n- \\x07Voluntary membership of sustainable sourcing platforms to\\n\\nengage with our industries and to enhance our capabilities;\\n\\n- \\x07Maintaining a systematic and integrated supplier risk\\n\\nmanagement system.\\n\\nWe are a member of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain\\nInitiative (PSCI), an association of pharmaceutical, biotech\\nand medical device industries. It aims to establish and promote\\nresponsible practices to improve ethics, labor, health, safety and\\nenvironmentally sustainable outcomes, as well as to improve\\nsupplier capability for member supply chains. This active\\nmembership enhances our organization’s capabilities and\\nprocesses in sustainable supply chain management. As a PSCI\\nmember, we perform audits of key suppliers and are in turn\\naudited with a similar scope by our customers.\\n\\nIn addition, Procurement established a comprehensive and\\nintegrated supplier risk-management process to support\\nsustainable business growth by capturing opportunities,\\nanticipating and mitigating supply risk.\\n\\nThe following key principles define the risk management\\nframework using Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) automation:\\n\\n- \\x07Key supplier risk assessment and management by global\\n\\nProcurement experts;\\n\\n- \\x07Integrating risk assessments into business processes to enable\\n\\nand support business continuity;\\n\\n- \\x07Using criteria and a risk register for scalable assessments of\\n\\nmaterials and suppliers;\\n\\n- \\x07Monitoring and ranking supply risks, including risk mitigation\\n\\nand implementation;\\n\\n- \\x07Embedding the supplier’s on-time/in-full delivery and quality\\n\\nperformance ratings into the risk assessment process.\\n\\n\\n**Responsibility**\\n\\n**Supplier Due Diligence**\\nAs part of our commitment to sustainable development, Lonza’s\\n[Supplier Code of Conduct sets high standards for suppliers and](https://www.lonza.com/~/media/Files/Policies/Supplier Code of Conduct/Suppliers_Code_of_Conduct_EN.ashx?la=en)\\nprovides a framework to evaluate their practices.\\n\\nWe carefully select and evaluate suppliers for security of supply\\nand specifications of materials and services. We also audit some\\nof our critical suppliers to assure and improve performance\\nand relationships, in line with the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain\\nInitiative (PSCI) principles.\\n\\nWe operate an automated anti-bribery and anti-corruption due\\ndiligence process, monitoring for high-risk suppliers. This is\\nrun by the Ethics & Compliance Group and integrated into the\\nprocurement and supplier management process through our\\nERP system (SAP). Third parties in qualification are blocked in\\nSAP until the due diligence process is complete. All third parties,\\nregardless of their interactions for Lonza, are screened and\\ncontinually monitored (i.e. Lonza is notified if there is a change\\nin screening status for any Lonza vendor).\\n\\nThe screening process includes real-time corruption, trade\\nsanctions, human rights, environmental and adverse media\\nscreening for all third party suppliers with increased due diligence\\nfor higher-risk third parties. For the latter, the process includes\\nmandatory completion of a due diligence questionnaire and\\ntailored anti-bribery, anti-corruption and competition law training.\\nResults from the questionnaire are scored using a proprietary\\nalgorithm that determines a vendor’s risk profile. Third parties\\nwith higher risk profiles are then further reviewed and assessed\\nby members of the Ethics & Compliance Group, with additional\\ndiligence being performed as required. Complete due diligence\\nis performed on a two-year automated cycle or on an ad hoc\\ncycle, depending on monitoring.\\n\\nNew Swiss and European legislation will increase the responsibilities\\nof large companies for their selected supply partners. In line\\nwith these new requirements, we are continually reviewing and\\nrefining our supplier due diligence processes and human rights\\nassessments. Specifically, conflict minerals and child labor will\\nbe introduced into the non-financial reporting requirements\\nin the coming year.\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n###### Environment\\n\\nWe continually strive to reduce our impact on natural systems and\\nthe environment, conserve energy and resources, assure safety,\\nhealth and wellbeing of our employees and help to improve the\\nquality of life in the communities in which we operate. The aim\\nof our “Vision Zero” initiative is to reduce workplace accidents\\nand injuries, environmental incidents and manufacturing process\\nincidents. Through these and other safety, quality and human\\nresource initiatives, we strive to make meaningful improvements.\\nPrograms are developed at site level, in alignment with company\\npriorities and goals. We build multi-year roadmaps to enable\\ncontinuous improvement, follow-up and reflect the type and\\nimpact of the operations over a number of years.\\n\\nThe targets are intensity targets based on million CHF sales to\\nfactor in Lonza’s continuous growth. They also reflect our diverse\\nand evolving product portfolio, which includes manufacturing of\\npharmaceutical ingredients, medical capsules, food supplements,\\ngene therapy and cell media production, and the licensing of\\ntechnology and systems. Such diversity can be integrated with\\na financial denominator, and using intensity targets also allows\\nus to carry forward this metric in the event of major acquisitions\\nor divestments. The targets and baseline have been reassessed\\nwith the divestment of the former Specialty Ingredients segment\\nand have been updated as shown below. We will review these\\ntargets to reflect the increased ambition levels.\\n\\n\\n**Higher Ambitions**\\nWith the commitment for the SDGs around Climate Action,\\nWater and Infrastructure we have introduced new or higher\\nambitions related to our environmental performance. In addition\\nwe have set an ambition to source the electricity we purchase\\nfrom renewable sources by 2025. In 2021, we also increased the\\n2030 energy efficiency target to 36%, meaning a reduction of\\n3%, per million of sales per year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nEnergy and resource efficiency within each site is the responsibility\\nof the site network and operations management, reporting to\\nthe operational head of the divisions. At a local level, operations,\\nengineering and environment, health and safety (EHS) departments\\nare responsible for devising and developing three-year rolling\\nsafety and sustainability roadmaps. These are designed to drive\\nour manufacturing sites towards compliance, efficiency and\\nsafety, thereby helping reach our overall sustainability targets.\\nLocal goals are added according to the materiality analysis at\\nthe sites (e.g. for water consumption and air emissions).\\n\\nEnergy use and CO 2 emissions, effluents, waste, water and\\nemissions data are reported quarterly to Corporate EHS and\\nGlobal Sustainability. This vital information forms the basis for\\nupdated reduction goals and potential capital expenditure\\nprojects to achieve major improvements in energy efficiency\\nalongside other areas.\\n\\nAt Lonza, we are continuing on our\\nsustainability journey and are proud of the\\nmilestones we have achieved so far.\\n\\nFollowing the divestment of the Specialty\\nIngredients business, we saw a footprint\\nreduction by around one third in GHG\\nemissions, and by half in energy and waste.\\nWe also recorded a substantial reduction\\n\\nin energy, GHG and waste intensity in\\n2021, compared to the 2018 baseline. This\\nwas due to significant growth without an\\nincrease in footprint, and efficiency gains.\\n\\nWe are committed to making further\\nprogress and have developed an\\nSDG framework with new or higher\\nESG performance targets to maintain\\nmomentum as we work towards this critical\\n\\nstrategic priority.\\n\\n\\n**Environment**\\n\\n**Our Progress in 2021**\\nOur absolute environmental footprint is significantly reduced\\nfollowing the divestment of the Specialty Ingredients business,\\nboth relative and absolute. More specifically, we saw a reduction\\nin greenhouse gas emissions of around one third, and a reduction\\nin energy consumption and waste generation by half. In addition,\\nin 2021 we sourced 28% of the electricity we purchased from\\n\\nrenewable sources.\\n\\nThe significant reduction we have recorded in the intensity\\nnumbers arerelated to significant growth without footprint\\nincreases, and efficiency gains. This is also a consequence of\\na shift in technologies, away from basic chemical production\\ntowards biologics and higher value compounds synthesis.\\nSpecifically the fourth quarter of 2021 saw an over-proportional\\noutput increase from new facilities, e.g. the Ibex [®] facility in Visp\\n(CH), deploying these technologies.\\n\\nAll environmental data relates to Lonza’s Continuing Operations\\n(and excludes the discontinued Specialty Ingredients business).\\nData for 2018, 2019 and 2021 has been rebased throughout\\nthis report to exclude Specialty Ingredients business data.

It is\\na precious, vital and burdened natural resource, of increasing\\nimportance and scarcity, which must be actively managed,\\nespecially in water-scarce locations.\\n\\nAccess to clean, plentiful and potable water is an important\\nfactor to ensure the quality of our products. Our sites are\\nnot located in areas known for major water risks or scarcity.\\nNevertheless, we are taking a series of measures to minimize\\ndownstream effects and water withdrawal impact on the local\\nenvironment and communities. Internal standards on water\\n\\nand wastewater include a water balance at site level in order to\\n\\noptimize usage and limit losses, reduce water usage through\\nasset optimization and process changes and promote water\\nrecycling and the use of rain water.\\n\\nIn addition, each site assesses local water risks and opportunities.\\nRisks could include water scarcity, droughts, or other supply\\nlimitations, discharge restrictions, risks associated with a direct\\ndischarge to natural water bodies or publicly owned wastewater\\ntreatment plants and emerging regulations. Opportunities\\ncould include ways to improve water conservation and resource\\nefficiency, ground and surface water protection, and discharge\\nquality. Our sites are required to identify stakeholders to address\\nwater in their local basin and downstream and encouraged\\nto explore and address locally relevant water issues such as\\navailability and quality.\\n\\nIn regions where freshwater is scarce, we may be exposed to\\nwater shortages or restrictions, water price volatility and a decline\\nin water quality. To mitigate these water-related risks, sites track\\ntheir water balance and run water management programs to\\nmeet agreed reduction targets. Sites in water-stressed regions\\nand geographies (e.g. India and Mexico), incorporate measures\\nto optimize water consumption and management into their\\nsustainability roadmaps.\\n\\nWe measure and monitor both industrial water (which may\\nbe altered chemically and physically by the manufacturing\\nprocesses) and non-contact cooling water (which is not altered,\\nexcept for temperature), as well as other indicators on water\\nsource and water output.\\n\\nEach site is responsible for managing and optimizing its water\\nbalance, with targets for quantity and wastewater set at a site\\nlevel. Globally, in line with our commitment to the SDG 6 Clean\\nWater and Sanitation, we will also track the status of water risk\\n\\nassessments at our sites and continue to strive to reduce our\\n\\nindustrial water use intensity.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Environment**\\n\\nMeiringen, Switzerland 31\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\n**Water Discharge**\\nSites hold local permits and follow all local requirements related to\\nwater treatment and relevant wastewater discharge parameters,\\nsuch as quantity and chemical limit values. In addition, Lonza’s\\nwaste and wastewater standard defines that sites handling APIs\\n(Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) – which are viewed as Lonza’s\\nsubstances of concern in this area – adopt a risk-based approach\\nregarding the discharge of wastewater. This approach is based\\non current industry practice as promoted by the Pharmaceutical\\nSupply Chain Initiative (PSCI). It involves comparing the predicted\\nenvironmental concentration (determined by mass balance or\\nanalytical means) with the Predicted No Effect Concentration\\n(PNEC). Effluent with a high risk is investigated in detail and a\\ntailored approach is taken (which may include a change to the\\ncleaning process, incineration of first rinse or an alternative\\nappropriate method).\\n\\nAt many of our sites, industrial water is collected in tanks\\nor reservoirs and treated in our own or external wastewater\\n\\ntreatment facilities. It is tested according to local permits\\nbefore discharge into the sewage system or into a surface\\nwater body. Due to the diverse nature of requirements, we\\ndo not report on discharge water quality. The following water\\nemission parameters are tracked at sites where the following\\nemissions are material: heavy metals, nitrogen, organics (COD\\nand TOC) and phosphorus. Other parameters are tracked in\\nline with local regulation and the type of operation undertaken.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**\\n\\nBased on scientific evidence, GHG emissions contribute to\\nglobal warming, largely caused by the combustion of fossil\\nfuels to provide energy. Energy generation, waste incineration\\nand other industrial processes also result in other emissions,\\nsuch as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur\\ndioxide (SO 2 ) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Our goal\\nis to continuously monitor and control such emissions, to\\ncomply with statutory requirements and to reduce them beyond\\nregulatory requirements. GHG emissions are categorized by\\nthree groups: Scope 1 and Scope 2 cover emissions from our\\noperations and our energy use, while Scope 3 includes all other\\nindirect emissions that occur in our value chain.\\n\\n32\\n\\n\\nOur GHG emissions result mainly from combustion processes\\nfor energy conversion (including incineration of waste). With this\\nin mind, we focus on managing the total energy consumption,\\nenergy sources and waste.\\n\\nTo decouple GHG emissions from energy consumption, we\\nstrive to increase the proportion of renewable electricity\\n(wind, hydro, solar, etc.). Our sites have energy efficiency and\\nwaste reduction measures as elements of their roadmaps and\\nalso apply low carbon energy alternatives, e.g. biomass. We\\nare implementing “sustainability by design” standards (energy\\nand water efficiency), to ensure growth projects are built with\\nbest-in-class technologies for low carbon and energy efficient\\nconsumption.\\n\\nIn addition, we are participating in research projects to evaluate\\ncarbon capture possibilities.\\n\\nSDG 13 **Climate Action**\\n\\n*\" \\x07In our work to enable a healthier world,*\\n\\n*we have committed to reduce our carbon*\\n*footprint over the next decade and*\\n*thereafter, as our business continues*\\n*its transformation.”*\\n*Stefan Stoffel,*\\n*Head of Group Operations*\\n\\nOur site in Nansha (CN) has several initiatives to improve\\nits energy efficiency and reduce its carbon emissions.\\nSensors are being installed to ensure that the lights on\\nthe road are only on when needed, as they used to be\\ncontrolled manually or by timer. The payback is estimated\\nto be one year. The concept will also be applied in offices\\nand bathrooms. In 2021 the site also began investing\\nin renewable power onsite. A 120 kW solar field was\\ninstalled on the roof, which will supply 10% of the electricity\\nconsumption in all office areas generating an estimated\\nsaving of more than 70 tons CO 2 -eq per year.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Environment**\\n\\n\\nSolving the Nitrous Oxide (N O)\\n2\\nLeakage in Visp (CH)\\n\\n\\nIn 2017, internal analyses at our Visp site indicated the presence\\nof nitrous oxide emissions within the Niacin production facility.\\nAs nitrous oxide is considered a GHG, we took appropriate\\nmeasures in cooperation with the Swiss Federal Office for the\\nEnvironment (FOEN), to reduce emissions.\\n\\nThe planning and construction of the catalytic removing stage\\nbegan so Lonza could hand over a well-functioning plant to the\\nnew owners of the Specialty Ingredients business in 2021. The\\nbuilding application for a catalyst was submitted at the end of\\n2019 and construction of the 18-meter high catalyst started as\\nsoon as permission was secured in January 2020.\\n\\n\\nWith the completed sale of the Specialty Ingredients business,\\nthe Niacin production facility was also transferred to the new\\nowner in July 2021. The Specialty Ingredients business successfully\\ncommissioned the nitrous oxide catalyst in early October 2021,\\nahead of schedule. Lonza is pleased that the new owner could\\nbring the catalyst on stream promptly so that the challenge has\\n\\nnow been addressed.\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\n**Scope 1 GHG Emissions**\\nScope 1 includes direct GHG emissions from sources owned or\\ncontrolled by Lonza. Emission factors are used for calculating\\nemissions from fuel combustion (CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O), including\\nfrom company-owned vehicles. CO 2 and N 2 O emissions from\\nother on-site processes, such as chemical reactions or waste\\nincineration are directly measured, calculated or estimated\\nby each site. A relevant part of our Scope 1 emissions comes\\nfrom onsite waste and waste gas incineration, which serves two\\npurposes: final waste treatment and energy production. From\\nthe 160,000 tons CO 2 -eq. from Lonza’s onsite waste incineration,\\nover 20% are due to waste incineration services that our site in\\n\\nVisp (CH) performs for two neighboring companies. However, due\\nto the GHG accounting rules these quantities are consolidated\\nin our reporting.\\n\\n**Total Scope 1 Emissions 2021**\\n#### 297\\n\\nThousand Metric Tons CO 2 -eq.\\n\\n\\n**Scope 2 GHG Emissions**\\nScope 2 encompasses GHG emissions from the electricity\\nand steam purchased. The reported values are calculated with\\nregion-specific standard emission factors using IPCC AR4 and\\nU.S. EPA Climate Leaders. At most of our sites, the purchased\\nelectricity and steam consumption is metered directly on own\\ndevices. In multi-occupant facilities, consumption is derived\\nfrom the total to reflect our proportionate consumption.\\n\\nWe report Scope 2 GHG values using two methods, “locationbased” and “market-based”. The “location-based” method\\n\\n(based on electrical energy consumption) reflects the total\\nelectricity consumption of the site, multiplied with local electricity\\ngrid average emission factors. The “market-based” method\\n(based on electricity production mix) reflects emissions from\\nelectricity sources we have selectively chosen to buy, e.g.\\nrenewable or nuclear energy certificates and claims, green\\ntariffs. For the company’s GHG- targets, the location-based\\n(consumption based) values are used to track energy efficiency\\ngains. Efficiency in this context means producing higher output\\nor achieving higher sales with the same amount of energy input\\nand related emissions.\\n\\nIn addition to energy- and GHG-efficiency, Lonza strives to be\\ncarbon neutral within the next three decades. This effort will\\n\\ninclude procuring renewable electricity to replace fossil electricity\\nin the coming years. The difference between location-based and\\nmarket-based values reflect the reduction in GHG emissions from\\n\\nthe purchase of renewables, and nuclear electricity, in addition\\nto energy efficiency gains. This reduction in GHG-emissions\\namounts to 23% of the Scope 2 footprint.\\n\\n**Total Scope 2 Emissions 2021**\\n\\n**(Location-based)**\\n#### 226\\n\\nThousand Metric Tons CO 2 -eq.\\n\\n**(Market-based)**\\n#### 173\\n\\nThousand Metric Tons CO 2 -eq.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Scope 3 GHG Emissions**\\nScope 3 includes GHG emissions from purchased goods\\nand services, business travel, upstream and downstream\\ntransportation, waste disposal, employee commuting, etc.\\n\\nWe have quantified our Scope 3 GHG emissions for 2021 after\\na first assessment of the various Scope 3 categories and their\\nrelative importance, using 2019 data.\\n\\nAs generally observed in our industry, Scope 3 GHG emissions\\nare considerably higher than Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The\\nmain part of our Scope 3 GHG emissions can be attributed to\\npurchased goods and services and capital expenditure. Waste\\ndisposal and fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in\\nScope 1 and 2) also contribute, though to a lesser extent. Business\\ntravel, employee commuting and downstream distribution are\\na minor contribution to the total Scope 3 emissions.\\n\\nAs a main element of our commitment to SDG 12 Responsible\\nConsumption and Production, we are launching a program to\\nimprove our Scope 3 performance, and are targeting a reduction\\nof GHG emissions across the supply chain by collaborating with\\nour top suppliers.\\n\\nThe underlying approximations rely on average industry data\\nand thus have some level of uncertainty. Therefore we will focus\\nour efforts creating more granularity and reduction action on\\nthe categories with the highest contribution.\\n\\n\\n**Environment**\\n\\nCalculations for the categories Purchased Goods and Services\\nand Capital Goods are based on spend data covering Q4 2020\\nto Q3 2021, all other data refers to Full-Year 2021. Upstream\\ntransportation (category 4) has been directly integrated in the\\nmodels for categories 1 and 2. Upstream leased assets (category\\n8) are included in Scope 1 and 2. Upstream transportation is\\nincluded in categories 1 and 2. Other categories are not integrated\\nin the calculation because they are either negligible or the data\\ncollection and modelling is not feasible.\\n\\nTo encourage sustainable mobility at the Visp (CH) site,\\na pilot project has been running onsite since June 2021,\\nwhere a fleet of five e-cars, 80 e-bikes and four e-cargo\\nbikes are available to Lonza employees around the clock.\\nThe fleet can be used free of charge to travel within the\\nsite, to and from work or to attend external meetings.\\nIn the first five months, over 2,300 employees used the\\nplatform to travel 218,000 km. If these journeys were\\nmade using an average car, up to 70 tons CO 2 eq could\\nhave been emitted.\\n\\nOur Bornem (BE) site has also implemented several measures\\nto promote a more sustainable commute. 91 bicycles were\\nmade available as part of a bike lease plan open to any\\nemployee. As part of the scheme, employees can choose\\na bicycle from a large selection - from standard to electric\\n\\n  - lease it for three years and have the option to buy at\\na later stage. Approximately 20% of the employees are\\nregistered and more interest is expected. To encourage\\ncommuting by bike, employees who do not participate in\\nthe bike lease plan have the opportunity to receive free\\nbike maintenance when cycling to work for more than 30\\ndays each year. In addition, charging points have also been\\ninstalled onsite for e-bikes and e-cars/hybrids. Cyclists\\nwith e-bikes can charge their bicycles for free.\\n\\n35\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Scope 3 Emissions 2021**\\n#### 2,452\\n\\nThousand Metric Tons CO 2 -eq.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\nMu cang chai, Vietnam\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**GHG Emissions Intensity**\\nThe carbon emission intensity values from Scope 1 and Scope 2\\n(location based) decreased by 33% in 2021 (compared to the 2018\\nbaseline), exceeding the 9% reduction target set in our long-term\\ngoal. We refer again to the over-proportional increase of sales\\nand technology shifts for the reduction effect. The absolute GHG\\nemissions from our Continuing Operations (Scope 1 and 2) saw\\na slight decrease compared to 2020 (approximately minus 1%).\\n\\nIn addition to our intensity target and in line with our commitment\\nto the SDG 13 Climate Action, we are setting internal targets\\nfor a yearly absolute reduction of our Scope 1 and Scope 2.\\nMetrics for the contribution to this SDG will also be linked to\\n\\nthe incentive compensation framework.\\n\\n|Col1|Carbon Emissions Intensity [tons CO2-eq /Mio.

For the Visp site, which manages operations for both Lonza\\nand the former Specialty Ingredients business, data for Continuing Operations was\\nextrapolated using allocation keys based on the usage intensity.\\n\\n\\n**Environment**\\n\\n**Waste**\\n\\nAs a company operating in the pharma, biotech and nutrition\\nmarkets, which includes chemical production facilities for\\nactive pharma ingredients, we strive to remain transparent with\\nstakeholders and local communities about how we manage\\nwaste and wastewater. Communities have a vested interest in\\n\\nwaste and water discharge from production.\\n\\nEach manufacturing site maintains a waste disposal operation\\ntailored to relevant waste streams for the efficient and\\n\\nenvironmentally sound treatment and disposal of waste outputs.\\nAll sites are committed to our waste reduction principles:\\n\\n\\nAt certain locations such as Visp (CH) or Nansha (CN), we\\noperate our own waste and wastewater treatment facilities.\\nAt other locations, we carefully select our partners for waste\\ntransportation and treatment based on performance and\\ncapabilities in safety and sustainability.\\n\\nWe aim to reduce waste resulting from manufacturing facilities,\\noffices and laboratories and ensure that the treatment and\\n\\ndisposal of all waste materials (including wastewater) is conducted\\nin full compliance with local regulations and international\\nstandards. The waste management system and performance\\nat our manufacturing sites are subject to regular inspections\\nand audits.\\n\\nWe are committed to increasing input materials efficiency in our\\nproduction processes, including reworking out-of-specification\\nproduction, yield improvement and re-use of ancillaries whenever\\npossible. We strive to reduce effluent by controlling and reducing\\nwater inputs and effluent pre-treatments. The final effluents\\nare managed and controlled according to the parameters\\npermitted by local authorities.\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\nAt our site in Visp (CH) we continue our solvent recycling\\nefforts. In 2021 the site regenerated 6,600 tons of solvent,\\nand treated 4,300 tons of contaminated water to reduce\\n\\nincineration.\\n\\n**Waste Generation and Significant Waste-related Impacts**\\nOur goal is to reduce the environmental impact of our activities\\nwhile meeting all quality and hygiene requirements. As a CDMO\\nfor the pharmaceutical industry, our influence is limited in\\nrelation to waste generated by customer-defined manufacturing\\nprocesses and downstream users behavior. Therefore any of\\nour improvements focus on own operations.\\n\\nThe production technology and quality requirements for biopharmaceutical production have changed in recent years. For\\nexample, the use of Single Use Technology (SUT), such as plastic\\nbags and appliances instead of stainless steel reactors and\\nimproved cleaning practices are reducing water use but increase\\nour waste streams. While this approach saves quantities used\\nto clean traditional vessels, it increases the amount of plastic.\\nAs this technology is relatively new, alternative disposal and\\nrecycling solutions are not broadly available and therefore a\\nlocal approach is favored. The SUT industry has still to develop a\\nrecycling or take-back system for the articles or develop reusable\\nparts of the assembly to allow users to reduce the burden.\\n\\nThe majority of our waste is managed by third parties that\\nhave been approved by the relevant authorities and our local\\nsites. We are currently working to strengthen this practice by\\nhaving harmonized contractual agreements and audits. We\\nhave also introduced a waste recycling KPI for internal waste\\nrecycled or reused onsite (including closed loop), to help track\\nand incentivize onsite circularity measures. Sites develop their\\nown circular measures, e.g. increasing the number of recycling\\ncycles of solvents, or using biomass waste as fuel.\\n\\n**Remediating Legacy Issues**\\n\\n**Mercury Remediation**\\nOur largest site in Visp (CH) continues to address legacy mercury\\ncontamination along a former wastewater discharge canal, on\\nsurrounding soils and other areas where contaminated sediments\\nwere deposited. This issue dates back to when Lonza used\\nmercury as a catalyst in chemical processes. From the 1930s to\\nthe 1970s, the site discharged industrial mercury-contaminated\\nwastewater into the canal, before the construction of the\\n\\nwastewater treatment plant.\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\nSince 2013, we have worked closely with local communities to\\nfinance and implement the required technical investigations in\\nresidential areas and agricultural zones between Brig-Glis and\\nNiedergesteln (CH). The remediation works in the residential\\narea started in 2017.\\n\\nBy the end of 2021, 142 parcels of land in Visp, Raron and BrigGlis (CH) were remediated, representing 88% of the residential\\nplots affected. The remediation on the contaminated agricultural\\narea started in 2021 with a first pilot remediation completed in\\nRaron (CH) in September. In 2022 the work will continue both\\nin residential and agricultural areas.\\n\\nWe are working closely with the Swiss Canton of Valais, the\\nmunicipalities and other relevant parties to resolve this industrial\\nheritage. We maintain a website on remediation activities and\\n\\nprogress.\\n\\n**Old Gamsenried Landfill**\\n\\nThe Gamsenried disposal site in Gamsen (CH) is owned and\\nmanaged by Lonza and consists of an old and decommissioned\\narea, alongside a new and fully permitted disposal site. The latter is\\nused for waste incineration slag from the Visp site and the regional\\nwaste incineration plant. The older, decommissioned section\\nwas primarily used between 1918 and 1978 for contaminated\\nlime hydrate and gypsum sludge. In this area, the management\\napproach includes groundwater monitoring and pump and\\ntreatment of contaminated groundwater at the edge of the\\nlandfill.\\n\\nThe detailed investigation of the old landfill according the\\nSwiss contaminated sites ordinance (CSO) has nearly reached\\ncompletion in 2021. Additionally, a risk assessment has been\\ncarried out in 2021, confirming that one area of the landfill\\nis responsible for the majority of the risk potential for the\\ngroundwater. The first phase of the remediation of the old landfill\\nwill focus primarily on this area, and Lonza has made financial\\nprovisions of CHF 285 million in the year 2021 for this program.\\n\\n**Waste Generated**\\n\\nIn line with our corporate reporting guidelines, construction,\\ndemolition, remediation and excavation waste are excluded\\nfrom the sustainability reporting framework. Only productionrelated waste is tracked at a corporate level. Solvents, which\\nare used as fuels at some of our sites, are reported as waste for\\nfuel, although they allow us to reduce natural gas consumption\\nconsiderably.\\n\\nOur sites and divisions are focusing on waste intensity reductions\\nas part of their site plans and roadmaps and are supported\\nby new guidance on waste management and minimization.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nA significant proportion of the increase in waste is due to the\\ncleaning in the API production, generating large amounts of\\nliquid waste which is incinerated to avoid contamination of\\n\\nwater streams.\\n\\nIn Visp (CH) and also in Nansha (CN), the energy generated in\\n2021 from incinerating waste solvents, by-products, and waste\\nwas 520 TJ, and from recovering waste heat was 470 TJ. These\\nreplace the consumption of 28 million m [3] of natural gas. Waste\\nthat is sent to landfill mainly consists of incinerator ashes and\\nsludges.\\n\\nThe waste generated and disposed by our Continuing Operations\\ndecreased by 8% compared to 2020.\\n\\n**Waste Intensity**\\nIn 2018, we defined a long-term global waste intensity reduction\\ntarget of 24% by 2030. In 2021, with focus on our continuing\\noperations, we have overachieved the 6% reduction target we\\nset ourselves for 2021. As the intensity table below shows, the\\nperformance improved considerably in 2021, as it was also the\\nfirst year with a reduction in total waste generated compared\\nto previous years.\\n\\n\\n**Environment**\\n\\nThe amount of waste generated can fluctuate due to several\\nfactors, including the following:\\n\\n- \\x07Use of SUT and additional cleaning practices to achieve\\n\\nrequired product quality is expected to increase our waste;\\n\\n- \\x07Changes in the product portfolio, which might include more\\n\\nor less waste intensive products and production processes;\\n\\n- \\x07Temporary shutdown of production lines, e.g. for optimization\\n\\npurposes;\\n\\n- Discarded production batches as a result of quality issues.\\n\\nOur sites have been making progress with their projects and\\nactivities to decrease waste. Some examples are listed below:\\n\\n- \\x07Reduction of waste intensity for several productions by\\n\\npretreating contaminated wastewater to make it suitable\\nfor wastewater treatment plant and to avoid sending it to\\nincineration, e.g. distillation of wastewater stream or active\\ncarbon treatment. In Visp (CH), this initiative avoided over\\n\\n- \\x07Increase in solvent recycling for several production lines, 900 tons CO 2 -eq in 2021;\\n\\nresulting in the reduced procurement of fresh solvents and\\ndecrease in the amount of solvent heading for incineration;\\n\\n- \\x07Process optimization, such as redesign of production processes,\\n\\nprocess streamlining and yield improvements.\\n\\n**Innovating for Sustainability**\\n\\nWe are committed to creating value for society by delivering\\ninnovative, science-based solutions for our customers in the\\nhealthcare industry.

We are\\nconstantly aiming to improve the efficient use of such solvents\\nand to increase their reuse and recycling, which reduces the\\nenvironmental footprint of the processes by reducing the\\nconsumption of fresh solvents and the amount of waste generated\\nand treated. Projects focus on the waste streams with potential\\nfor optimization, based on size and feasibility. In parallel, the\\nprojects aim to reduce production downtime through waste\\ndisposal, de-bottlenecking and simplified logistics.\\n\\n\\nIn 2021, the projects implemented in the Small Molecules\\nprocesses in Visp (CH) avoided 4,400 tons of wastewater being\\nincinerated by treating it with other technologies, saving more\\nthan 900 tons fuel related CO 2 -eq. In addition, we are currently\\nrecycling 10,000 tons of solvents and therefore save an estimated\\n48,000 tons CO 2 -eq per year, by avoiding incineration and\\nconsumption of fresh solvents. At the Nansha (CN) site, the\\nprojects implemented in 2021 recycled 2,100 tons of solvents,\\nsaving an estimated 10,080 tons CO 2 -eq.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Environment**\\n\\nPoland 41\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n###### People and Society\\n\\nTo enable a healthier world, Lonza engages with employees,\\ncommunities and charitable organizations.

We will continue our “Vision Zero”\\ninitiative, a program which has led to a considerable reduction\\nin safety incidents. Ultimately we are striving for zero workplace\\ninjuries, process incidents, or environmental incidents.\\n\\nWe have set targets and are measuring safety corrective\\nactions (safety CAPA) which are generated by our workforce.\\nThis program drives identification and closure of safety related\\nobservations and improvements across our site network. The\\ninitiative has moved the focus from a lagging injury-based\\nmetric, to a leading indicator driving employee behavior and\\ninvolvement. It resulted in more than 32,200 documented safety\\nimprovements in 2021, largely identified and corrected by our\\nmanufacturing workforce. In 2021, we experienced a Lost Time\\nIncident Frequency Rate of 0.35 (per every 1 Mio. workhours) – a\\ndecrease compared to 0.62 in 2020, and a Recordable Incident\\nRate of 0.52 (per every 200,000 workhours) – a slight increase\\ncompared to 0.48 in 2020.

Ultimately, every\\nemployee contributes by identifying risks and unsafe conditions,\\nobserving safe behaviors and working safely at all times. Safety\\nis a condition of employment.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2022 our Nansha (CN) site received the\\n“Green Factory” award by the Chinese Ministry of Industry\\nand Information Technology (MIIT). This award recognizes\\nthe site’s diligent work to improve its operations. Not\\nonly does the site now have certified EHS, occupational\\nhealth and safety and energy management systems (ISO\\n14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 50001), it also has numerous\\nimprovement initiatives on water and energy consumption,\\nGHG reduction and on material intensity, e.g. recovery of\\nwaste solvents. In addition, the site is also implementing\\nrequirements on sustainable performance expectations\\nfor their raw materials suppliers.\\n\\nWhile our Safety and Sustainability policy defines high level\\nprinciples, our corporate EHS management system and local\\nEHS standards guide our actions and clarify specific roles\\nand responsibilities. Some sites are certified according to the\\noccupational safety standard ISO 45000 or Responsible Care.\\nOur management system has been fully aligned to ISO 45000\\nrequirements since 2019.\\n\\nEHS standards include:\\n\\n- \\x07Guidelines including Health Surveillance, Critical Work, and\\n\\npolicies on incident tracking and reporting;\\n\\n- \\x07Operational policies establishing minimum standards to ensure\\n\\nthe safety of employees across a variety of activities;\\n\\n- Site Security and Business Continuity Planning;\\n\\n- \\x07Construction Site Policy, which includes contractor requirements.\\n\\nWe regularly audit sites and locations – on average every three\\nyears – to ensure compliance with rules and regulations, technical\\nintegrity and effective management systems.\\n\\n\\n**Social**\\n\\nWe actively monitor our performance in occupational health and\\nsafety. A monthly analysis report is distributed to all employees.\\nThese reports and subsequent activities are carefully tracked\\nand measured, then global and local management adapt\\napproaches accordingly.\\n\\n**Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Incident**\\n**Investigation**\\nWork-related hazards are addressed through hazard identification\\nand reporting (including near-miss incidents), job safety analyses,\\nsite inspections and process hazard reviews. Site employees\\nare trained to use these tools and local and global EHS leaders\\ncollaborate with each site to ensure the workplace is safe and\\nproductive. The reporting of unsafe conditions and near-miss\\nincidents is encouraged, with a site-specific target and reward\\nprogram based on the number of corrective actions implemented\\nto mitigate any identified potential hazards.\\n\\nAll incidents are investigated. A formal investigation and root\\ncause analysis process, aligned with an internationally recognized\\nmethodology, is used for recordable injuries as well as significant\\nprocess safety incidents and environmental incidents. In 2021,\\nfull training was conducted for 53 employees. All employees\\nare trained to stop and to refuse actions that they consider\\nhazardous for themselves, their colleagues and/or the community\\nand environment.\\n\\n**Occupational Health Services**\\nOperating sites have processes in place to recognize, evaluate\\nand control occupational health risks. Where required, we have\\nsupplementary medical surveillance programs. All sites also\\nhave a designated clinician or physician to administer medical\\nsurveillance and evaluate occupational injuries or illnesses.\\n\\n**Worker Participation, Consultation, Communication and**\\n**Training on Occupational Health and Safety**\\nWorker participation is required to address safety improvements\\nand behavior. In many cases, sites have a safety committee\\nintegrated into the EHS council to oversee all safety-related\\nmatters. Additionally, all sites are required to conduct frequent\\nsafety meetings in all teams and escalate any identified safety\\n\\nconcerns.\\n\\nAll sites conduct required safety training on hazardous materials\\n(HazCom), critical safe work procedures, evacuation and process\\nsafety, among many others. As required in our EHS Management\\nSystem, each site is required to establish and maintain a Safety\\nand Sustainability Training Matrix and Plan, which includes a\\nlisting of required training topics, training frequencies and\\nmethods, either by job title or a similarly effective means. It\\nintegrates topics which reflect changes in site activities, risks\\nand regulations.\\n\\n43\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\nIn 2019, our global initiative “ *Be a Safety Leader* ” (BSL) was\\nlaunched, to create the best possible safety culture with the\\ninclusion of all colleagues. BSL is an initiative to help all employees\\nunderstand how to actively contribute and lead the day-to-day\\nprocess of ensuring our work environment is the safest it can\\nbe. This culture change initiative has now been launched at 28\\nsites globally. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, associated travel\\nrestrictions and social distancing requirements, the launch of\\nthe program at some sites was delayed. Instead, an alternative\\nformat of the training and materials was developed and a\\nvirtual version was launched during the second half of 2020.\\nThis has allowed sites to continue to roll out the initiative and\\n\\nselect the best means of delivering the content, either virtually\\nor in a classroom setting, based on individual needs and local\\nCOVID-19 restrictions.\\n\\nSites are required to train all colleagues, establish site\\nimplementation teams and develop creative approaches to\\nconducting hazard assessments, defining critical behaviors\\nand providing coaching at all levels to ensure implementation.\\n\\n**Promotion of Worker Health**\\n\\nAll Lonza employees are motivated and passionate about the\\ncritical importance of health, safety and injury prevention. They\\nunderstand that investing in prevention and employee health\\nand wellbeing pays dividends and ensures colleagues remain\\nfully engaged. Health programs are managed at site level.\\n\\n\\n**Prevention and Mitigation of Occupational Health and**\\n**Safety Impacts**\\nWe continuously monitor our operations to identify potential\\nhealth risks to our employees. This includes (but is not limited to):\\n\\n- Job and technical hazard assessments, e.g. ergonomic hazards;\\n\\n- Technical improvements;\\n\\n- Training and education;\\n\\n- \\x07Substance exposure monitoring for chemical exposures, according\\n\\nto the limit values set by the Corporate Toxicology group.\\n\\nOur products are primarily pharma-related products. In addition\\nto the required safety information, these products and their raw\\nmaterials undergo extensive testing, registration requirements\\nand instructions for use, so that they can be used safely in the\\nmarket. The COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges, which\\nwe addressed by issuing global and local guidance on how to\\nadapt the workplace to ensure hygiene and social distancing\\nmeasures could be effectively enforced. Specific guidance was\\nalso published for employees who work remotely.\\n\\n**Work-Related Injuries**\\nOver the course of 2021, we recorded a total of 13 Lost Time\\nInjuries, which is lower than last year’s number (22). The number\\nof Recordable Incidents was 96 in the reporting year.\\n\\nMost injuries recorded and analyzed in 2021 were the result of\\nchemical contact, lifting, slips, trips, falls, sprains and strains,\\nwhich can be common in our industry. There were no injuries\\nresulting from commuting incidents from transport organized\\nby the company.\\n\\nLost Time Injury Frequency Rates (LTIFR) are calculated based on\\none million hours worked. Data represents employed workforce\\nand agency workforce in regular manufacturing processes.\\nWorkhours reported include direct employees and agency\\n\\nworkers.\\n\\n\\n\\n44\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nAll incidents are analyzed identifying the most probable causes\\nand corrective actions. The depth and detail of each investigation,\\nthe investigation method and the level of participation by local\\nmanagement, employees, and other functions, is commensurate\\nwith the nature and scale of the incident and its impact.\\n\\n**Diversity and Equal Opportunity**\\n\\nWe recognize and welcome the critical value of diversity across\\nour employee community and actively encourage a culture of\\ninclusion. We understand that programs to support diversity\\nand inclusion must be focused on influencing long-term, durable\\nchange. We have updated the nomenclature of our Diversity\\nand Inclusion Taskforce to reflect this focus. It has now been\\n\\nnamed the Inclusion, Diversity and Belonging (IDB) Council.\\n\\nThe IDB Council promotes inclusion and reflects diversity\\nacross backgrounds, characteristics, preferences, beliefs and\\nperspectives. Comprising a community of passionate and\\nengaged volunteer members, the role of the Council is to\\ndevise and manage IDB programs as well as sharing knowledge\\nand insights across our network. To achieve this, the Council is\\nsupported by a global community of IDB Ambassadors based\\nat a site level. This enables an integrated approach in which\\ninitiatives are cascaded to employees from the group, as well\\nas allowing individual sites the freedom to provide support\\nthat is relevant to specific employee communities and cultural\\ncontexts. The Council and Ambassadors meet regularly to share\\nideas and experiences. The Council also facilitates knowledge\\nsharing within the Ambassador community and the scale-up of\\nlocal initiatives where relevant to our wider corporate context.\\nThe Council is sponsored by a dedicated Steering Committee\\ncomprising senior leaders from Legal, HR and Communications\\nto represent and advocate IDB at the Executive Committee\\n\\nand Board level.\\n\\n**2021 Safety Performance**\\n\\n\\n**Social**\\n\\nThroughout 2021, the IDB and its affiliated groups hosted a series\\nof events at a local and global level which were designed to reflect\\nand amplify the company’s commitment to creating an inclusive\\nenvironment. At a local level, multiple sites hosted workshops\\nto recognize, explore and celebrate local and international\\ncultural holidays. Additionally, as part of this commitment, and\\nrecognizing the stresses of remote onboarding and working,\\na “One Year at Lonza” workshop was organized. This aimed to\\nensure all new joiners felt a collective sense of belonging and\\nconnection by sharing their views and experiences. Other local\\ninitiatives included our support for Armed Service Veterans at\\nour Portsmouth, NH (US) and Greenwood, SC (US) sites. These\\nsites featured a diverse group of veterans on TV show Military\\nMakeover – Operation Career, which highlighted our support\\nfor veterans in our employee community. At a global level,\\nwe hosted several virtual “Rise Up” events for all employees\\nfrom across the organization to listen to internal and external\\nperspectives on the uniquely female experience of the workplace.\\nThese meetings also provided a forum for the group to share\\nand discuss specific challenges and opportunities relating to\\nwomen in the workplace.\\n\\nSDG 5 **Gender Equality**\\n\\n*“ \\x07We want to attract women to every part of our*\\n\\n*business and achieve greater female representation at*\\n*all levels as Lonza grows.\"*\\n*Caroline Barth,*\\n*Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO)*\\n\\n#### 96\\n\\nRecordable work-related Injuries /\\n\\n80 for Continuing Operations\\n#### 2.6\\n\\nRecordable work-related Injury Rate\\n\\n(per 1 million hours) /\\n2.3 for Continuing Operations\\n\\n\\n13 Lost-Time work-related Injuries /\\n#### 10 for Continuing Operations [13] 37\\n\\nMio.

Additionally – and\\nimportantly – our Code of Conduct prohibits any form of\\ndiscrimination. It states that we do not tolerate any discrimination,\\nharassment or bullying, especially on the basis of ethnicity,\\nnational origin, color, religion, sexual orientation, creed, age,\\nsex, disability or any similar characteristic. This requirement also\\napplies to all our business partners (both direct and indirect)\\nthroughout our supply chain.\\n\\n**Employee Recruitment, Retention and**\\n**Development**\\n\\nSupporting leadership development has been a focus throughout\\n2021. A solid leadership program has been developed to emphasize\\nthe role of the leader in modelling our values and empowering\\nand coaching our employee community. Further key priorities\\nin 2021 have included ongoing succession planning at the\\nsenior level and ensuring rigor in talent reviews for the wider\\norganization. This work will help to ensure we maintain a robust\\nand sustainable talent pipeline to align with our growth trajectory.\\nIn line with this, we have observed an internal promotion rate of\\n3%, which represents an increase of 0.7% compared to 2020.\\n\\n2021 saw further extensions and enhancements to the existing Lonza\\nmentoring program, which is offered across many divisions and\\nfunctions. This is designed to support learning and development,\\nstrengthen a mentoring culture and promote networking across\\nthe global business. LinkedIn Learning also continues to offer 24/7\\nlearning access to all our employees. It enables social learning\\nacross the business and it is used as a tool to enable employees to\\nundertake self-directed learning across a broad range of businessrelevant subjects. During 2021, 34% of employees used LinkedIn\\nlearning, with 5,250 courses and 141,500 videos completed.\\nAs leadership development remains a priority, we attach great\\nimportance to delivering ongoing training to our people leaders.\\nThis is provided through a manager fundamentals course which\\nalso encourages networking opportunities. These programs are\\noffered across our divisions and corporate functions, including\\nresearch and development, quality, operations and manufacturing.\\n\\nSDG 4 **Quality Education**\\n\\n*“ \\x07We want to be recognized as a company*\\n\\n*with a deeply embedded learning culture*\\n*that invests in providing continuous*\\n*education opportunities for all*\\n*generations of employees.\"*\\n*Philippe Deecke,*\\n*Chief Financial Officer (CFO)*\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\nWe actively work to provide a competitive reward package to\\nsupport employee attraction and retention. Rewards are reviewed\\nand benchmarked annually at a global and local level to ensure\\nwe provide competitive compensation levels compared to our\\nindustry peers. The rewards system has been reviewed in 2021\\nand will undergo structural change in 2022. This will include an\\nupdate to our bonus plan to provide a greater proportionate\\nrecognition of personal contribution as well as reflecting wider\\ncompany performance on environmental, societal and governance\\nindicators. Finally, we are working towards the introduction\\nof an employee share plan in selected test countries in 2022.\\n\\nWe understand that employee retention can be supported by\\nour incentive plans. With this in mind, for our senior employees,\\nwe operate a performance related share plan. This includes a\\ncontractual compensation element that is awarded annually\\nand links to our group financial performance, measured over a\\nthree year performance period. It encourages the retention of\\nsenior talent by providing the opportunity to share in our long\\nterm business success.\\n\\nThe provision of equal pay at Lonza is a primary foundation of\\nour global HR and Reward practices, and Lonza ensures that its\\nHR practices fulfil equal and gender pay reporting requirements\\nacross the world. This includes Switzerland under Art. 13c GEA\\n\\nand the UK Gender Pay Reporting requirements. We continue\\nto review pay equality across the employee population.\\n\\nChildcare support is offered through local government schemes\\nat a market level. Compensation for atypical working hours also\\nfollows local legislation and varies across our global site network.\\nThis includes – but is not limited to – additional annual leave,\\nshift premiums, standby and call out allowances and one-time\\nrecognition awards to compensate extraordinary efforts for\\nspecial projects.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nTo support talent acquisition and recognition across our\\norganization, we have a number of successful programs:\\n\\n- \\x07Our global Talent Referral Program encourages and incentivizes\\n\\nour existing employees to refer friends and acquaintances\\nfor vacant positions across our business. In 2021 we saw a 9%\\nincrease in the number of referrals and a broadly consistent\\nproportion of candidates being successfully sourced through\\nthe program. This represented 470 referral hires in 2021\\ncompared to 152 in 2020. This increase was primarily driven\\nby the significant increase in overall hiring in 2021.\\n\\n- \\x07We operate a cross-market online recognition program, named\\n\\nBRAVO. Using this platform, more than 4,600 individual “thank\\nyou” messages and awards were sent across the business over\\nthe course of 2021. The goal of the program is to encourage\\ncollaboration and recognition across the network, thereby\\nsupporting and enabling a positive and self-reinforcing\\ncompany culture.\\n\\nAll of these initiatives align with the broader People strategy of\\nCome, Stay and Grow. More detail on this People Strategy can\\nbe found in our Annual Report.\\n\\n\\n**Social**\\n\\n**Performance Management**\\nOur performance management process is consistent across our\\nemployee community. At the beginning of the year, employees\\nare set stretching individual and team goals aligned to our\\nstrategic priorities. This is designed to unite and galvanize\\nthe global colleague community to achieve high levels of\\ncompany performance and individual development. The\\nperformance review process is linked to our incentive plans,\\nso employees feel rewarded for their efforts. It also provides\\nstructure and focus to ongoing performance, development and\\ncareer conversations between managers and employees. The\\nperformance management process has been reviewed in 2021\\nto ensure that it remains robust for the future. A new approach,\\nwhich provides an enhanced level of alignment to our group\\nvalues and enables employees to include a behavioral goal, will\\nbe implemented in 2022.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\n**Employee Engagement**\\n\\nOur Employee Value Proposition (EVP), “A Meaningful Difference”,\\nreflects how our colleagues work to fulfill our purpose of enabling\\na healthier world. This purpose is underpinned by our four core\\ncompany values:\\n\\n   - \\x07 **Integrity**   - we act with integrity by being accountable,\\n\\nhonest, and having the courage to speak up and do the\\nright thing;\\n\\n   - \\x07 **Inclusion**   - we demonstrate inclusion, by being supportive,\\n\\nrespectful and responsible towards others;\\n\\n   - \\x07 **Innovation**   - we innovate, by being engaged, curious\\n\\nand enquiring to find the best possible solutions;\\n\\n   - \\x07 **Initiative**   - we take the initiative as a community of self\\ndriven colleagues who are motivated and committed\\nto focus and deliver.\\n\\nAlongside these values, our purpose is supported by a focus\\non caring for our people, our customers and our planet. These\\ncommitments enable our employees to better connect with\\nthe global organization and act as ambassadors who are\\nempowered, engaged and equipped to contribute to the\\ncompany’s future growth.\\n\\nTo ensure we promote and encourage strong performance,\\nwe actively work to listen to our colleagues’ views and needs.\\nTo understand employee sentiment in 2021, we launched our\\n“Voice of the Employee” (VoE) global employee engagement\\nsurvey, focusing on inclusion and culture. It received an overall\\nresponse rate of 65% from our global employee population.\\nWhile this is a strong start to the measurement and evaluation\\nprocess, we are aiming to achieve higher engagement levels in\\nfuture editions of the VoE survey. The survey outcomes were\\nanalyzed at a company, division, site and team level to allow\\nmanagers across the business to understand and act on both\\ngeneral and specific needs.\\n\\nAt a group level, the VoE survey identified strengths in how\\ncolleagues view their prospects, their ability to contribute to\\ncompany success, and their sense of empowerment, purpose\\nand pride. Areas of opportunity were identified at a manager\\nlevel and our people leaders have been given support to develop\\nimprovement programs to address local challenges. This work\\nwill continue in 2022, alongside the distribution of future surveys\\nto track progress and identify further areas for improvement.\\n\\nIn an effort to support our employees more broadly, a global\\nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP) was launched in the second\\nhalf of 2020 to address professional, personal, psychological\\nand financial needs. The program complements several existing\\nlocal support services by offering anonymous counselling\\nthrough a specialized partner organization.\\n\\n48\\n\\n\\nA number of additional programs have been introduced to\\nsupport our employee community in 2021. With up to one\\nthird of our global workforce continuing to work remotely\\nin line with local government restrictions and our on-site\\nworkers continuing to physically attend manufacturing sites\\nand research and development (R&D) facilities, frameworks on\\nhow to continue to work remotely and on-site effectively and\\nsafely were established, as well as support mechanisms to cope\\nwith the pandemic through our EAP. Throughout this time, we\\nbegan to consider the future new working environment in line\\nwith Back to Office planning.\\n\\nWith the pandemic placing added pressure on our employee\\ncommunity, we have sought to enhance our wellbeing offering.\\nAn online wellbeing platform providing a single source of advice\\non health, wellness and lifestyle has been developed in 2021,\\nand will be piloted in selected areas of the business in 2022.\\n\\nWe have also worked at a site level to support the development\\nof young talent. In 2021, we have organized and hosted a number\\nof apprenticeship programs, as well as our first graduate\\nprogram at our Slough site (UK). Such programs enable more\\ninclusive paths into our business for young people through roles\\naligned to academic subjects including science, technology,\\nengineering and mathematics (STEM). In addition, we launched\\na wellbeing campaign called “Wellbeing Wednesdays,” which\\nprovided employees with informational articles and tools\\nto support education and self-assessment alongside tips to\\nimprove personal and professional wellness.\\n\\nAs part of our wider commitment to sustainability, we have formed\\na network of colleagues from our largest sites (in which we have\\nmore than 100 employees) to share corporate responsibility best\\npractices and experiences. This team connects on a quarterly\\nbasis, and representatives from each site share accounts of\\nvolunteer activities and other community engagement programs,\\nsuch as those mentioned in pages 48 to 51.\\n\\n**Investing in Communities**\\n\\n**Our Sponsorship Approach**\\nIn many of the communities where we operate, we act as a\\nneighbor, a vital source of jobs, a charitable sponsor of local\\nnon-profit organizations and a significant contributor to the\\nlocal economy. While our financial donations are important, our\\ngreatest contributions come from our employees who volunteer\\nin projects that are meaningful to our communities. We focus\\nour charitable giving and volunteer activities on selected projects\\nthat align with our SDGs and where our contributions make a\\ndifference, as shown in the examples below. We evaluate the\\nrecipients of any contribution to ensure they promote high\\nstandards of ethics and compliance and a low proportion of\\nadministration charges, in the programs we support.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Good Health and Wellbeing**\\n**\\x07Continuing to Support the Fight against COVID in**\\n**Underprivileged Communities**\\nWe provide funding to Hand in Hand (HiH) India, a non-profit\\norganization that focuses on child labor elimination and education,\\naccess to healthcare, empowerment of women through livelihood\\ncreation, skill development, natural resource management\\nand solid waste management. Our support of HiH began in\\n2020 and continued throughout 2021. At the Chengalpattu\\nGovernment Hospital, which receives more than 3,500 patients\\na day, we have provided a battery-operated car to help transfer\\npatients to the appropriate buildings on the hospital campus.\\nOur funding also supported field teams and communication\\ncampaigns to support awareness, registration and COVID-19\\nvaccination for more than 5,000 people, in addition to providing\\ngeneral guidance on how to stay healthy during the pandemic.\\n\\nThis initiative aligns with our Gender Equality, Clean Water\\nand Sanitation and Climate Action SDGs. Our contribution\\n\\nsupports the work of HiH’s Green Friends, a team of workers who\\nprovide sanitation services to more than 100,000 households\\nin six states in India. Understanding that combatting climate\\nchange at the local level is imperative, especially in a developing\\ncountry such as India, HiH launched its solid waste management\\ninitiative in 2007 to encourage segregation of waste at source\\nand ensuring proper disposal of waste. More than 70% of the\\nGreen Friends are women; they are often single and therefore\\nthe sole breadwinners for their families. By offering this job,\\nwe help provide them with wages, dignity in the workplace,\\nsafety equipment and ration kits so they may safely continue\\ntheir work during the pandemic.\\n\\n\\n**Social**\\n\\n**Supporting the Fight against Cancer**\\nEmployees from our Bornem (BE) site raised funds for and\\nparticipated in the 1,000 kilometer bike ride “Fight against\\nCancer”. Dozens of employees participated in the annual event\\nwhich spanned four days. Our Greenwood, South Carolina (USA)\\nsite participated in fundraising for “Relay for Life”, to support the\\nAmerican Cancer Society. Our Puebla (MX) site provided funding\\nto “Una Nueva Esperanza”, supporting services to children with\\ncancer. Volunteers from our Portsmouth, New Hampshire (USA)\\nsite made birthday cards for local children with cancer and other\\nlife-threatening illnesses in partnership with “Lucy’s Love Bus”,\\na non-profit organization focused on improving the quality of\\nlife for the children it serves. Colleagues from our Morristown,\\nNew Jersey (USA) site raised funds for and participated in “Light\\nthe Night” for the fifth consecutive year, supporting the work\\nof the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, whose mission is to find\\ncures and provide support to patients and their families. Lonza\\nwas honored as a 2021 Top Corporate Team by the Society.\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\n**Donating Blood in a Critical Time of Need**\\nWe support various national and local blood donation\\norganizations, including the Red Cross, with financial support\\nand coordinating site blood donation events. Our contribution to\\nthe American Red Cross also supports disaster relief, specifically\\nfor those impacted by tornados and western wildfires. This\\nsupport helps enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to\\nand help people recover from these disasters.\\n\\nColleagues from our Houston, Texas (USA) site participated\\nin blood drives with Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center to help\\nreplenish their community’s needs, which serves the Texas\\nMedical Center, the largest medical center in the world.\\n\\n**Providing Food to Nourish our Neighbors**\\nColleagues from our sites around the world, including Tampa,\\nFlorida (USA) and Porriño (ES) volunteer at local food banks and\\nprovide food donations to ensure those in need have access\\nto nutritious meals. Our Houston, Texas (USA) site worked with\\nUnited Way to prepare snack and hygiene kits for the homeless\\npopulation and children in need.\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\n**Gender Equality**\\n**Supporting Mothers in STEMM Careers**\\nLonza has set an ambition to increase gender equality across the\\norganization. To also increase equality in society, we contribute\\nto the work of Mothers in Science (MiS), an international nonprofit organization providing much needed research and support\\nfor mothers in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math and\\nMedicine (STEMM). MiS raises awareness of career obstacles\\nfaced by mothers working in STEMM fields and advocates\\nfor workplace equity and inclusion, providing resources for\\nindustry, academia and individuals. Our support helps fund\\nglobal research that addresses the obstacles. It also supports the\\ndevelopment of webinars and the expansion of its mentorship\\nprogram, whereby those new in STEMM fields can be paired\\nwith volunteer mentors who have navigated the combined\\nchallenges of motherhood and a career.\\n\\n**Quality Education**\\n**Providing Support for Education in Science**\\nWhile we establish an education program in the company, we\\nalso support outside initiatives. Various sites have donated\\nlaboratory equipment to local schools and universities, including\\nPorriño (ES), Houston, Texas (USA) and Cologne (DE). Around\\nthe world, colleagues donate time to support local students,\\nincluding Nansha (CN), where colleagues lead experiments\\nwith primary school students; Houston, Texas (USA), where we\\nprovide guest lectures and scholarships in Science, Technology,\\nEngineering, Math and Medicine (STEM) programs and in Visp\\n(CH), where colleagues lead lessons and experiments with local\\nvocational and high schools.\\n\\nIn addition, we have continued our ongoing annual support\\nfor Schweizer Jugend forscht (Swiss Youth in Science), a nonprofit organization that brings together young people who\\nare passionate about research and coaches to support the\\ndevelopment of scientific research in a variety of areas. This\\nprogram supports the education of you people on their journey\\nto become the next generation of innovators.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Environment**\\n\\n**Planting Trees and Keeping**\\n**Communities Clean**\\n\\nOur team in Singapore participated in a greening initiative\\nat Singapore’s Tuas Biomedical Park, which is home to many\\nbiomedical companies including Lonza. This initiative also supports\\nSingapore in its One Million Trees movement, a nationwide effort\\nto plant a million trees across Singapore over the next ten years.\\nIn Houston, Texas (USA), a group of colleagues also participated\\nin various tree-planting and public clean-up events to support\\n“Keep Pearland Beautiful”, a local non-profit organization\\ndedicated to protecting the environment and community in the\\narea. Volunteers from our Portsmouth, New Hampshire (USA)\\nsite also spent time cleaning local coastal areas to support the\\nlocal community and its wildlife.\\n\\n\\n**Social**\\n\\n**Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure**\\n**Enabling Innovative Solutions**\\nWe support the Swiss Cancer Foundation (SCF), which brings\\nbusinesses and individuals together in the fight against cancer.\\nThe SCF aids institutions and organizations such as Krebsliga\\nSchweiz and Stiftung Krebsforschung Schweiz by supporting\\ninnovative research, prevention and treatment projects to\\nimprove the life and health of cancer patients. Since 2019, we\\nhave contributed to SCF projects including the development of\\na centralized digital platform to provide crucial information in\\nthe diagnosis and treatment of patients and a research project\\nexploring new treatment options with immunotherapy. We are\\ncommitted to continue our support of SCF to help bring innovative\\nsolutions to patients in need. This initiative also delivers against\\nour Good Health and Wellbeing SDG in supporting those with\\ncancer and the efforts to find a cure.\\n\\nWe also continue to support platforms that bring together\\nexperts in various fields, including economics, science and\\nsociety.

Therefore, we are not collecting specific information about collective bargaining agreements in affiliates. Generally, Lonza Group companies are established in countries where representation of employees is the rule, via work councils, unions and collective bargaining agreements. Local management is responsible for maintaining good labor relations according to legal requirements and agreements with unions, work councils and other employee representing bodies. We respect these relationships and work with these parties in a mutually respectful manner. In addition to the country-specific employee representation, we have also established a European Work Council that holds regular meetings.

These events can have negative impacts such\\nas food and water availability, land erosion, fires and damage to\\nthe built and natural environment. They could potentially affect\\nLonza’s operations and our ability to provide our customers with\\nthe services and technologies needed to enable a healthier world.\\n\\nWe routinely evaluate risk categories including climate-related\\nrisks as part of our general business management, Enterprise Risk\\nManagement (ERM) program and Business Continuity planning.\\nWe strive to avoid, reduce or mitigate risks all with anticipated\\nnegative impacts of defined magnitude. However, some general\\ndevelopments may also present business opportunities.\\n\\nLonza is committed to following the recommendations of the\\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\\n\\nThis document addresses the disclosures in a framework which\\n\\nincludes four pillars: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and\\nMetrics & Targets. We aim to provide quantitative disclosure on\\nclimate-related topics in the future as we continue to incorporate\\nthe TCFD recommendations into our business.\\n\\n**Governance**\\n\\n**Board Oversight**\\nGovernance and oversight over Sustainability and ESG is with\\nthe Board of Directors, headed by the Chairman of the Board,\\nwith specific aspects to be covered by the Board’s committees\\n(Nomination and Compensation Committee, Audit and Compliance\\nCommittee, and Innovation and Technology Committee). While\\nthe Board acts as sponsor and overall owner of the program, the\\nimplementation is the responsibility of the EC. The Lonza Board\\nof Directors (Board) receives regular updates on climate related\\nrisks as part of its oversight of the environmental, social and\\n\\n\\ngovernance (ESG) agenda, which are presented and discussed at\\nBoard meetings. Lonza’s climate-related targets and results are\\ndiscussed annually at Board level, in the context of Sustainability\\nreporting. The Board also has oversight of enterprise risks and\\nopportunities that are identified through the company’s ERM\\nprogram, and which are reviewed annually.\\n\\n**Management Oversight**\\nSenior management, and in particular the Lonza Executive\\nCommittee (EC), is responsible for continuously monitoring the\\nevolution of the risks and opportunities and the risk mitigation\\nprogress in the organization. To ensure that risks are managed\\nat the appropriate level, the heads of the Business Units,\\nOperational Units, Corporate Functions and Business Services\\nOrganizations provide adequate and timely reporting to the\\nEC. The EC escalates the information about significant risks to\\nthe Board as appropriate.\\n\\nIn addition to this governance structure and under the leadership\\nof the CEO, the EC has responsibility for reviewing and approving\\nthe company’s sustainability agenda, including climate, waste\\nand energy targets. The EC and the Board receive a quarterly\\nupdate on the status of our waste, energy and GHG intensity\\ntargets.\\n\\nLonza’s EC has direct oversight of and involvement in the\\nERM program. At the EC’s direction, the Head of Corporate\\nResponsibility and ERM is responsible for mapping and addressing\\nall enterprise risks and opportunities, including those that\\nare climate-related, as part of the ERM program. The EC’s\\nresponsibility includes oversight of actions to reduce likelihood\\nof occurrence and the potential impact of negative risks, and\\nconsideration of opportunities as part of longer-term strategy\\ndevelopment. Annually, the EC reviews, discusses and assesses\\nthe ERM findings for reporting to the Board.\\n\\nMore details on Governance may be found in the corresponding\\nchapters of the Sustainability Report, specifically on the\\nSustainability and Risk Committee (SRC) and the Safety and\\nSustainability Steering Board (SSSB), which coordinate the\\nsustainability strategy and activities throughout the company,\\nincluding climate change and climate-related measures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n58\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Strategy**\\nLonza’s purpose is to enable a healthier world. To achieve our\\npurpose, we have defined five strategic priorities. These guide\\nour business activities and practices, to ensure that we can\\ncapture and capitalize upon our unique points of differentiation.\\n\\nLonza is committed to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.\\nGlobal and individual site roadmaps address concrete actions\\nand projects to support achievement of the corporate goals\\nand work with global functions such as Engineering for new\\ninfrastructure and growth investments.\\n\\nOur environmental footprint and its impact on our business does\\nnot stop at our own operations. It also extends to our external\\npartners. The Sustainability and Procurement teams will work\\ntogether to manage climate strategy and actions in the supply\\nchain. Our first step is collaboration with our top suppliers.\\n\\nWe have included several ESG targets in our group-wide incentive\\nplan as of 2022. These include targets for achieving reductions\\nin each of the Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emission\\ncategories.\\n\\n**Sustainability Roadmap**\\nWe currently focus on monitoring our progress against our 2030\\nsustainability targets, enhancing our public disclosures for ESG\\ntopics and providing guidance and support for sustainabilityrelated initiatives across our sites globally. We are launching\\na project to source the electricity globally from renewable\\nsources by 2025.\\n\\nIn 2020, we initiated a program to evaluate and identify the\\nmain contributors to our value chain GHG footprint (known as\\nScope 3), which are mainly from the products and services we\\npurchase. We are working to engage with the largest suppliers\\nto start to continuously reduce our Scope 3 footprint.\\n\\n\\n**GRI and TCFD Overview**\\n\\nWe are reevaluating our sourcing strategy taking into account\\navailability of raw materials, logistics and risks for supply chain\\ndisruptions. We are also further developing our existing due\\ndiligence process for suppliers, to identify and minimize the risks\\nof occurrence in our supply chain, e.g. for environmental and\\nlabor misconduct. Being a member of the PSCI (Pharmaceutical\\nSupply Chain Initiative) we align with its principles and also\\nshare supplier audits with the industry group. Key elements of\\nour sustainability agenda are more fully described in the Risk\\nManagement section below.\\n\\n**Risk Management**\\nOur ERM program is a critical element of our strategic planning\\nand provides a mechanism and structure for risk management.\\nThe focus of the program is on risks and opportunities that may\\naffect the company’s strategic and financial targets or impact\\nthe mid-to long-term success of the business. The annual ERM\\nprocess is as follows:\\n\\n- \\x07Step 1: Identification and assessment of risks through bottom-up\\n\\nrisk scanning with individual risk owners in meetings and with\\n\\nsurveys;\\n\\n- \\x07Step 2: Consolidation, review and prioritization of risks by\\n\\nthe cross-functional ERM team, including mapping of trends\\nversus prior year;\\n\\n- \\x07Step 3: Workshop with the leadership teams of each Executive\\n\\nCommittee member reporting to the CEO and the Group\\nGeneral Counsel to review and finalize the ERM team’s findings\\nand document mitigation measures;\\n\\n- \\x07Step 4: Presentation and discussion of consolidated enterprise\\n\\nrisk overview and relevant mitigation measures to the Executive\\nCommittee;\\n\\n- \\x07Step 5: Presentation and discussion of top risks and relevant\\n\\nmitigation measures to Board of Directors;\\n\\n- \\x07Step 6: Throughout the year, monitor status of mitigation\\n\\nmeasures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\nOur ERM program focuses on risks and opportunities that could\\naffect our mid-term business strategy. Given the nature of our\\nbusiness, most climate risks that could materialize in this time\\nframe are limited to site-specific natural disasters and extreme\\nweather events, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, etc. These\\nrisks are managed by business continuity plans (see below).\\nAdditional climate-related risks are unlikely to be material\\nduring this time horizon. We do not consider our business to be\\ncarbon intensive, natural resource intensive (land, marine) and it\\nis not consumer goods oriented. Therefore, our current focus\\nto implement climate-related scenario analysis is at site level.\\n\\nOutside of the ERM program, longer term implications of\\nclimate change are relevant for site-level planning, such as water\\navailability, storm frequencies, wastewater disposal limitations\\nand flooding. The risk management of these implications is part\\nof our ongoing Business Continuity planning.\\n\\nNear-term local risks, e.g. flooding risks, storm risks, are assessed\\nfor all manufacturing locations and business continuity plans\\nare in place. In summary, the company has an overview of the\\nindividual risks at the sites and any open actions to mitigate\\nsubstantial impacts. We intend to include long-term climate\\nrisk scenario planning into our risk management and business\\ncontinuity management program.\\n\\n**Regulatory risks**\\nThe main regulatory risks identified concern the potential revision\\nand uncertainty of developing carbon dioxide tax instruments\\nand changing or new cap and trade systems following the\\nParis COP21 agreement. In the European Union, changes could\\nincrease the price of certificates and/or lower the amount of\\nfree allowances granted. In other parts of the world, new carbon\\npricing policies are planned or are being implemented.\\n\\nThese changes could affect Lonza\\'s operations directly or\\nindirectly leading to an increase in operating costs, as well as\\nadditional management focus and efforts, including monitoring,\\nreporting and verification. In addition, due to the different\\nspeeds at which regional legislation is put in place, there is\\npolicy asymmetry in the short to medium term.\\n\\nFor the moment, energy cost or carbon pricing are not yet a\\ndecisive factor in the consideration as to where to locate our\\n\\nactivities. An increase in fuel and energy costs are expected and\\nrecognized by the business strategies and Lonza considers the\\nrisks as part of its annual ERM program. The energy price impact\\nrisks apply worldwide, however more exposed are operations\\nin developed regions such as Europe and the US. It is expected\\nthat energy efficiency regulations will become more stringent\\nand increasingly be integrated into environmental legislation\\nand vice versa, while at the same time planning will remain\\nchallenging as the volatility in political decision making may\\nbe increasing.\\n\\n60\\n\\n\\nThe potential annual financial impact of fuel prices and carbon\\ncosts depend on the magnitude of changes in the fuel market\\nand the degree to which the carbon pricing policies across\\ncountries evolve.\\n\\nIt is difficult to estimate the financial implications of carbon\\ntaxes. Fuel and energy taxes as well as regulations could have\\na negative financial impact. The expansion of schemes into\\nother legislations will require additional management focus.\\nEfforts to align with suppliers will also take time and resources\\nthat have not yet been determined.\\n\\nMany investments to reduce the carbon budget are not within\\ntraditional payback expectations of business expansions, and\\nare generally not routinely accepted in the industry. Therefore,\\nwe are refining our standards for considering and approving\\nthese capital investments to allow a more long-term perspective\\nof sustainability and cost benefits when making major capital\\ninvestments.\\n\\n**Physical risks**\\nExtreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts\\nand fires, can seriously affect the company\\'s operations and\\nsupply chain processes. However, the additional contribution\\nof adverse effects induced by climate change is uncertain and\\nmay lead to an increase in frequency.\\n\\nFor example, in 2020, the state of Louisiana (USA) was severely\\nhit by hurricanes Laura and Delta with our former Lake Charles\\nsite impacted. As such risks are mostly local, our manufacturing\\nsites have contingency plans and back-up systems in place, to\\nmake informed decisions on the acceptable level of risk and\\nthe physical investments needed to address such risks as part\\nof our business continuity planning.\\n\\nLonza sites require fresh water for manufacturing and also\\nuse water for cooling. Increased temperatures could reduce\\ncooling capacity by quantitative limits on water intake (physically/\\nby authorities). Water risks are local by nature and therefore\\nsites need to address local water risks as part of their business\\ncontinuity plans and safety and sustainability roadmaps.\\n\\nAs an example, exposure to risk of flooding at the large Visp\\nmanufacturing complex in Switzerland has been drastically\\nreduced with the completion of the correction of the river Rhone.\\nThe river bed now provides for almost full high water capacity.\\nThe multi-year regional project was financed and executed by\\nthe state and supported by public funding on a national level. A\\nminor probability of flooding at our Visp site may still potentially\\nlead to business interruption for a limited time. The risk is known\\nand evaluated and the necessary contingency plans exist and\\nare ready to be activated.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Reputational risks**\\nLonza’s performance and value is also increasingly measured by\\nits sustainability performance. Failure to achieve expectations\\ncan harm the company\\'s reputation and potentially customer\\ntrust into Lonza as a supply partner. To provide transparency\\nand accountability to Lonza’s stakeholders, Lonza started\\nsustainability reporting according to the GRI standards in 2018\\nand established ESG targets beginning in 2019.\\n\\nOur sites regularly engage with their relevant stakeholders on\\na local level. On a corporate and divisional level we engage with\\nour customers on improving the sustainability performance of\\nour services, which also includes joint projects and knowledge\\nexchange. We are active on several social media channels to\\nreceive feedback from individuals or groups. Our ongoing intense\\ndialogue with stakeholders, especially with the sustainability\\nexperts of financial and proxy advisors, helps us to refine our\\nscope and identify other material topics.\\n\\nWe also conduct materiality assessments to set priorities for\\nour strategy and targets. The first materiality assessment was\\nconducted in 2018. We have completed a materiality assessment\\nwith our new focus as a pure-play pharma, biotech and nutrition\\nbusiness in 2021. In this assessment, we gathered input from\\nvarious stakeholder groups, e.g. employees, customers, scientific\\ncommunity, shareholders, financial analysts, our management\\nand Board. This information is utilized to inform our priorities\\nand strategy.\\n\\n**Opportunities**\\nInnovation potential is unlocked through the introduction of\\nenergy efficient technologies and alternative project ideas and\\ncooperation with external companies, e.g. the use of excess steam\\nof an external waste incinerator to substitute fossil fuels at the\\n\\nproduction complex in Visp (CH). The installation of solar panels\\nin sites is also being advanced, currently five sites have onsite\\nphotovoltaic panels. Reduction in energy reduces expenses,\\nas well as absolute emissions, and the decrease in emissions\\nalso reduces the exposure to future carbon pricing schemes.\\n\\nSince 2018, we have been working with a partner to analyze\\ndata for energy consumption, contracting and supply and\\ndemand. This has given us a better understanding so that we\\ncan further improve energy efficiency, manage costs and serves\\nas a starting point for conversion of our electricity demand into\\n\\nrenewable sources.\\n\\n\\n**GRI and TCFD Overview**\\n\\nWe measure our energy use on a regular basis. Energy use is\\nreported quarterly into a centralized global software tool and\\nthe data is analyzed by the global Environment, Health, Safety\\nand Sustainability teams. This vital information forms the basis\\nfor updated reduction goals and possible investment projects\\nto achieve major improvements in energy efficiency and other\\nareas. Some sites have adopted an energy management system\\naccording to the ISO 50000 framework, which encompasses\\nan energy team, policy, target setting and a rolling action plan.\\n\\nThis engagement also aims for reduced exposure to future\\nfossil fuel price increases and carbon costs. The opportunities\\nare mostly managed on a local basis, therefore the cost savings\\nhave not yet been consolidated.\\n\\n**Metrics and Targets**\\nWe report on our direct and indirect GHG emissions (Scope\\n1, 2 and 3) and other data in the Environment section of our\\nSustainability Report, and in our most recent response to the\\nCDP climate questionnaire, which is publicly available.\\n\\nWe have a GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2 location based) intensity\\ntarget of a 36% reduction by 2030 (2018 baseline), by a million\\nof sales per year and a waste intensity reduction target of 24%.\\n\\nWe have now set the ambition to source the electricity we\\npurchase globally from renewable sources by 2025. We also\\nincreased our energy efficiency target to a 36% reduction per\\nmillion sales per year by 2030 (2018 baseline).\\n\\nFollowing our 2030 energy and GHG intensity targets, we have\\nestablished annualized milestones which we have been achieving\\nyear on year. We have also restated our data for 2018-2021 to\\nexclude the data from our divested Specialty Ingredients business.\\nSpecifically for 2021, the target was -9% GHG emissions/mio\\nCHF revenue compared to the 2018 baseline, and we achieved\\n-33%. Several of our sites are investing in energy efficient\\nequipment, implementing projects to capture waste energy and\\nhave also been installing onsite renewable energy equipment,\\nlike photovoltaic panels and biomass boilers.\\n\\nAs part of our strategy to decrease the footprint of our\\ninfrastructure, we are implementing “sustainability by design”\\nstandards specifically for energy and water efficiency, to build\\ngrowth projects with best-in-class technologies for a low carbon\\nand low resource infrastructure. We are also participating in\\nresearch projects aiming to evaluate carbon capture technologies.\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**Sustainability Report 2021**\\n\\n**Legal Disclaimer**\\n\\n**No Warranty and No Liability**\\nWhile Lonza Group Ltd and its affiliates (collectively and individually,\\nthe “Lonza Group”) make efforts to include accurate and up-todate information, they make no representations or warranties,\\nexpress or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the\\ninformation provided on this publication and disclaim any liability\\nfor the use of this publication or any publication linked to it.\\nLonza Group may change this publication at any time without\\nnotice but does not assume any responsibility to update it.
