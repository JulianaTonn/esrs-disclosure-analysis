The report also mentions that \"Low representation in some EEA countries is linked to countries with small headcounts,\" but this does not necessarily imply that there are gaps in social protection coverage. The report's statement that \"environment should act as a leveler/equalizer and not augment the disparity\" is a vague and unverifiable statement that does not provide concrete information about countries with gaps in social protection coverage.\n",

      "The company describes initiatives for delivering positive impacts for its workforce. The report highlights various measures aimed at promoting the well-being of its workforce, including initiatives for women, addressing structural conditions, and promoting training and skill development. For instance, the company mentions that the specific initiatives for women focus on the entire female workforce, also beyond management positions (Source 185). Additionally, the report notes that the actions relating to the structural conditions are much broader and ultimately address the entire workforce (Source 185). Furthermore, the company highlights positive impacts on secure employment, social dialogue, training and skill development, and employees' working time (Sources 46, 47, 48, and 42). However, it is essential to note that these initiatives might be subject to greenwashing, and the report's authenticity should be scrutinized.\n",
